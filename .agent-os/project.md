# SingleBrief - Agent OS Project Configuration

## Project Overview

**Product Name**: SingleBrief  
**Product Type**: AI-Powered Intelligence Platform  
**Stage**: Development (Post-Design, Implementation Phase)  
**Architecture**: Full-Stack Web Application with AI/ML Pipeline  

## Product Description

SingleBrief is an AI-powered intelligence operative designed for managers and team leads. It consolidates team intelligence, document data, and personal sources (email, calendar, cloud files) into one unified AI interface. The tagline is "Answers from everyone. Delivered by one."

The system proactively collects, synthesizes, and delivers intelligence rather than requiring users to chase updates across multiple sources. It includes persistent memory that learns over time and adapts to user/team behavior patterns.

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Task Queue**: Celery with Flower monitoring
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain
- **Vector DB**: Pinecone/Weaviate
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0, JWT

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.0.4 with TypeScript
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Framer Motion
- **State**: Zustand, React Query
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Web Server**: Nginx
- **Development**: Hot reload, automated testing
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging, Sentry integration
