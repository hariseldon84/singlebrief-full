# üé® SingleBrief UI Design Guide & Frontend Generation

This document provides comprehensive guidance for designing and generating the SingleBrief user interface, consolidating information from the product requirements and architecture specifications.

## üéØ Objective

SingleBrief is an AI-powered intelligence operative designed for managers and team leads. It consolidates team intelligence, document data, and personal sources (email, calendar, cloud files) into one unified AI interface. Rather than users chasing updates, SingleBrief proactively collects, synthesizes, and delivers the final answer. It learns over time, remembers decisions, and adapts to how each user and team operates.

**Tagline**: "Answers from everyone. Delivered by one."
