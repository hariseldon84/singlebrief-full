# Epic 2: Core AI Intelligence System ðŸ§ 

## Epic Overview
Build the core AI intelligence components including the Orchestrator Agent, Synthesizer Engine, and Trust Layer that form the brain of SingleBrief's intelligent query processing and response generation.

## Epic Goals
- Implement the central Orchestrator Agent for query coordination
- Build the Synthesizer Engine for AI-powered content synthesis
- Create the Trust Layer for confidence scoring and source attribution
- Establish LLM integration with RAG pipelines
- Enable intelligent query parsing and response generation

## Epic Success Criteria
- Orchestrator Agent can parse queries and coordinate data gathering
- Synthesizer Engine can combine multiple data sources into coherent responses
- Trust Layer provides confidence scores and source traceability
- System processes queries end-to-end with <3 second response time
- AI responses include proper source attribution and confidence indicators

## Stories

### Story 2.1: Orchestrator Agent Core Framework

1. Orchestrator Agent class with query parsing capabilities
2. Intent recognition and classification system
3. Module routing and coordination framework
4. Task queue integration for async processing
5. Error handling and fallback mechanisms
6. Basic query validation and preprocessing
7. Response aggregation and formatting

### Story 2.2: LLM Integration and RAG Pipeline
**As a** system  
**I need** integrated LLM capabilities with retrieval-augmented generation  
**So that** queries can be answered using both AI knowledge and retrieved context

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. OpenAI/Claude API integration with proper authentication
2. RAG pipeline for context retrieval and augmentation
3. Prompt engineering framework for different query types
4. Token management and cost optimization
5. Response streaming for real-time user feedback
6. Model switching capabilities for different use cases
7. Safety and content filtering mechanisms

### Story 2.3: Synthesizer Engine for Multi-Source Data
**As a** manager  
**I want** coherent responses that combine information from multiple sources  
**So that** I get complete answers without information fragmentation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Multi-source data aggregation and deduplication
2. Contradiction detection and resolution
3. Information prioritization based on source reliability
4. Response structuring and formatting
5. Context preservation across data sources
6. Temporal information handling (recent vs. historical)
7. Source attribution and citation generation

### Story 2.4: Trust Layer and Confidence Scoring
**As a** manager  
**I want** to see confidence scores and source attribution for all responses  
**So that** I can trust the information and validate it if needed

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Confidence scoring algorithm for AI responses
2. Source reliability and freshness scoring
3. Uncertainty quantification and communication
4. Source attribution with clickable references
5. Raw data toggle for transparency
6. Confidence threshold configuration
7. Audit trail for all confidence calculations

### Story 2.5: Query Processing Optimization
**As a** user  
**I want** fast response times even for complex queries  
**So that** SingleBrief feels responsive and efficient

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Query complexity assessment and routing
2. Parallel processing for independent data sources
3. Caching strategy for frequently asked questions
4. Response time monitoring and alerting
5. Query optimization and rewriting
6. Progressive response delivery (streaming)
7. Performance metrics dashboard

## Technical Dependencies
