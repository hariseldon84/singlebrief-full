# Story 14.12: Centralized API Key and Configuration Management System

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** SingleBrief platform administrator  
**I want** centralized management of all third-party API keys, integration credentials, and service configurations through SuperAdmin  
**So that** I can manage configurations without code deployments, enable per-client customization, and maintain enterprise-grade security

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Complete migration of all third-party credentials from environment files to encrypted SuperAdmin storage
2. Real-time configuration updates without system restart across all services and applications
3. Multi-tenant configuration support allowing different settings per client organization
4. Comprehensive validation preventing invalid configurations from being deployed to production
5. Complete audit trail showing all configuration changes with user attribution and timestamps
6. Configuration versioning with one-click rollback to previous working configurations
7. Zero-downtime configuration updates with graceful fallback mechanisms and automated recovery

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Secure Configuration Storage (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Implement encrypted configuration storage with enterprise-grade AES-256 encryption
  - [ ] Build secure configuration API with authentication, authorization, and access control
  - [ ] Create configuration migration tools for moving credentials from environment files
  - [ ] Add key management integration with AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault, and Azure Key Vault
- [ ] Task 2: Real-Time Configuration System (AC: 2, 7)
  - [ ] Develop real-time configuration propagation using WebSocket or Server-Sent Events
  - [ ] Implement hot-reload mechanisms for application configuration without service interruption
  - [ ] Build configuration synchronization across distributed services and microservices
  - [ ] Create graceful fallback with default configurations and automatic error recovery
- [ ] Task 3: Multi-Tenant Configuration (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Implement per-client configuration support with tenant-specific settings and overrides
  - [ ] Build configuration inheritance with global, tenant, and user-specific levels
  - [ ] Create configuration templates for different client tiers and service levels
  - [ ] Add configuration isolation ensuring complete tenant data separation
- [ ] Task 4: Validation and Safety (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Develop comprehensive validation engine with service-specific validation rules
  - [ ] Implement configuration testing framework with pre-deployment validation
  - [ ] Build safety checks preventing invalid or dangerous configuration deployment
  - [ ] Create rollback automation for failed configuration deployments
- [ ] Task 5: Audit and Version Control (AC: 5, 6)
  - [ ] Implement immutable audit logging with cryptographic verification of changes
  - [ ] Build configuration versioning with Git-like branching and tagging capabilities
  - [ ] Create change attribution with complete user context and approval workflows
  - [ ] Add one-click rollback with automated testing and verification
- [ ] Task 6: Configuration Management Interface (AC: All)
  - [ ] Develop intuitive UI for complex configuration management and visualization
  - [ ] Build bulk configuration operations with import/export and template management
  - [ ] Create configuration documentation with contextual help and best practices
  - [ ] Add configuration testing integration with validation and deployment workflows

## Dev Notes

### Configuration Management Architecture Context
This story centralizes all service configuration management and integrates with:
- SuperAdmin Authentication (Story 14.1) for secure configuration access control
- Client Lifecycle Management (Story 14.2) for per-tenant configuration management
- Token Usage Monitoring (Story 14.4) for rate limiting and quota configuration
- All other SuperAdmin stories requiring secure configuration management

### Technical Dependencies
- Enterprise-grade encryption and key management systems (AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault)
- Real-time configuration distribution with WebSocket/SSE protocols
- Configuration validation framework with service-specific rule engines
- Version control system adapted for configuration management with audit trails

### Configuration Categories Migration
Complete migration from environment variables to centralized management:

**LLM and AI Services Configuration:**
- OpenAI API keys, organization IDs, and model-specific rate limits
- Anthropic API keys, Claude configurations, and usage settings
- Future LLM provider credentials with dynamic provider switching
- Regional API endpoints with geographic optimization and failover

**OAuth and Authentication Services:**
- Slack Client ID/Secret, Bot Tokens with workspace-specific configuration
- Google Workspace credentials with domain-specific settings
- Microsoft Teams/Office 365 with tenant-specific configuration
- GitHub, Zoom, and additional OAuth providers with scope management

**Communication and Notification Services:**
- Email service configurations (SendGrid, AWS SES, Mailgun) with template management
- SMS services (Twilio, AWS SNS) with geographic routing
- Push notification services with platform-specific configurations
- Webhook endpoints with validation secrets and retry policies

**File Storage and Media Services:**
- AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob with bucket/container management
- CDN configurations with edge caching and global distribution
- File upload limits and allowed types with security validation
- Media processing configurations with optimization settings

**Monitoring and Analytics Services:**
- Sentry DSN with project-specific configuration and alerting
- DataDog API keys with application monitoring and custom metrics
- Google Analytics with measurement IDs and conversion tracking
- Custom analytics with privacy-compliant data collection

### Security Architecture
Enterprise-grade security with zero-knowledge administration:
- **Encryption at Rest**: All configuration data encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all configuration API communications
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with granular permission management
- **Key Rotation**: Automated API key rotation with zero-downtime updates
- **Compliance**: SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA compliant configuration management
- **Zero-Knowledge**: SuperAdmin operators cannot access decrypted data without authorization

### Performance Requirements
- Configuration updates: Zero-downtime updates with <30 second global propagation
- Validation speed: <500ms for comprehensive configuration validation
- Rollback time: <2 minutes for complete configuration rollback and recovery
- Multi-tenant isolation: 100% configuration isolation between client organizations
- Audit completeness: 100% configuration change tracking with immutable audit trails
