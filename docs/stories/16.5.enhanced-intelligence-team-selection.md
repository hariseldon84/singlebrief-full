## Intelligence Selection Algorithm

### Selection Scoring Factors
```yaml
relevance_score:
  expertise_match: 40%      # Match between query topics and member expertise tags
  role_alignment: 25%       # Alignment between query type and member role/designation
  bio_similarity: 20%       # Semantic similarity between query and member bio
  historical_success: 15%   # Past response quality for similar queries

availability_score:
  current_workload: 30%     # Inverse of current workload percentage
  status_availability: 25%  # Online/busy/offline status consideration
  timezone_alignment: 20%   # Working hours overlap with query urgency
  recent_activity: 25%      # Recent query frequency and response rate

final_selection:
  weighted_score: (relevance_score * 0.7) + (availability_score * 0.3)
  minimum_threshold: 0.4    # Minimum score for automatic selection
  maximum_members: 5        # Maximum auto-selected members per query
  manual_override: true     # Allow manual addition/removal of members
```

### Query Analysis Framework
```yaml
query_analysis:
  topic_extraction:

    - Business domains (marketing, sales, finance, operations)
    - Project phases (planning, execution, testing, deployment)
    - Problem types (blockers, decisions, status updates, feedback)
  
  urgency_detection:
    - High: deadline, urgent, asap, critical, blocker
    - Medium: soon, this week, important, priority
    - Low: when possible, low priority, future, someday
  
  response_type:
    - Informational: status, update, report, summary
    - Decision: approval, choice, recommendation, opinion
    - Technical: solution, implementation, troubleshooting
    - Creative: ideas, brainstorming, alternatives, innovation
```
