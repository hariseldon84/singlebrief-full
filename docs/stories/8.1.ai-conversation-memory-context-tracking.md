# Story 8.1: AI Conversation Memory and Context Tracking

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** query creator  
**I want** SingleBrief to remember previous queries, responses, and outcomes  
**So that** I can build on past conversations and the AI can provide increasingly relevant and contextual intelligence

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Persistent conversational context storage with vector-based semantic relationships
2. Pattern learning and recurring theme recognition across conversations
3. Historical context integration that improves response relevance over time
4. Memory decay management with intelligent prioritization of important contexts
5. Cross-session memory continuity that maintains context across login sessions
6. Relationship mapping between queries, responses, and follow-up outcomes
7. Privacy controls allowing users to manage and delete conversation memory

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Vector Database Memory Storage (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Design conversation memory schema with vector embeddings
  - [ ] Implement semantic relationship mapping between conversations
  - [ ] Create efficient vector search for context retrieval

  - [ ] Build response improvement through historical learning
- [ ] Task 4: Memory Management System (AC: 4, 7)
  - [ ] Implement intelligent memory decay algorithms
  - [ ] Create memory prioritization based on importance and recency
  - [ ] Build privacy controls for memory management
  - [ ] Add user controls for memory deletion and export
- [ ] Task 5: Cross-Session Continuity (AC: 5, 6)
  - [ ] Design persistent memory across user sessions
  - [ ] Implement conversation threading and relationship tracking
  - [ ] Create outcome correlation and tracking system
  - [ ] Build seamless context restoration on login

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements the foundational memory system for Epic 8's AI intelligence capabilities. It integrates with:
- Memory Engine (Epic 3) for persistent storage infrastructure
- Core AI Intelligence (Epic 2) for LLM integration and context injection
- Team Interrogation AI (Epic 6) for conversation data collection

### Technical Dependencies
- Advanced vector database (Weaviate/Pinecone) for semantic storage
- Machine learning pipeline for pattern recognition and theme detection
- Real-time analytics for memory scoring and prioritization
- Privacy and security framework for memory access controls

### Privacy Requirements
Based on SingleBrief's privacy-by-design principles:
- All conversation memory must be opt-in with clear consent
- Users must have full control over memory retention and deletion
- Memory data must be encrypted and access-logged
- Cross-team memory sharing requires explicit permission

### Performance Requirements
- Vector search response time: <100ms for context retrieval
- Memory storage: Support for 10,000+ conversations per user
- Pattern recognition: Real-time theme detection with <200ms processing
- Cross-session continuity: <50ms context restoration on login
