- Tailwind CSS correctly configured with custom theme and design system
- Grid layout implemented with appropriate responsiveness classes (grid-cols-1, lg:grid-cols-12)

#### 2. Navigation structure for core features ✅
- Well-structured sidebar navigation with collapsible functionality
- Mobile-responsive design with hamburger menu implementation
- Clear organization of primary and secondary navigation links

#### 3. User profile and settings management UI ⚠️
- Basic user profile and settings UI implemented
- Login/registration forms available
- Missing comprehensive profile editing and preference management features

#### 4. Integration status and health indicators ⚠️
- Basic integration card components created
- Incomplete implementation of health monitoring and status indicators
- Missing real-time status updates via WebSocket

#### 5. Basic query input interface ✅
- Query input component implemented with relevant features
- Search history functionality included
- Voice input support not fully implemented

#### 6. Mobile-responsive design ⚠️

#### 7. Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) ❌
- Critical accessibility features missing
- No ARIA attributes found in component implementations
- Lack of keyboard navigation support documentation
- No evidence of accessibility testing (axe-core, Lighthouse)
- Missing focus management, skip links, and screen reader optimizations

### Code Quality Review

#### Strengths
1. **Component Structure:** Well-organized component hierarchy with separation of concerns
2. **Design System:** Comprehensive color palette and design tokens in Tailwind config
3. **Reusable Components:** Base UI components created with variants and proper TypeScript typing
4. **State Management:** Evidence of centralized state management with context and stores

#### Areas for Improvement
1. **Accessibility:** Critical lack of accessibility implementation (ARIA, keyboard nav, focus management)
2. **Testing:** No evidence of unit, integration, or accessibility tests
3. **Documentation:** Missing component documentation and usage examples
4. **Mobile Optimization:** Limited mobile-specific interaction patterns and touch optimizations
5. **Real-time Features:** WebSocket implementation for live updates appears incomplete

### Security Review
1. Authentication integration appears properly implemented
2. Basic form validation present in login and registration forms
3. Missing CSRF protection documentation
4. No evidence of XSS protection strategy

### Performance Considerations
1. No evidence of performance optimization techniques
2. Missing lazy loading implementation for improved initial load
3. No documented bundle size optimization strategy

### Recommended Actions
1. **High Priority:**
   - Implement comprehensive accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
   - Add automated accessibility testing with axe-core
   - Complete mobile-specific optimizations and testing
   - Add unit and integration tests for critical components

2. **Medium Priority:**
   - Enhance documentation for components and usage examples
   - Complete real-time update functionality with WebSockets
   - Add performance optimization techniques (code splitting, lazy loading)
   - Complete integration status monitoring features

3. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) implementation
   - Enhanced animation and transition system
   - Comprehensive end-to-end testing suite

### Conclusion
The basic dashboard UI framework implementation meets several core requirements but falls significantly short on accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA), which is a critical acceptance criterion. The codebase shows good structure and organization but lacks essential testing and accessibility features. Recommend addressing the high-priority items before considering this story complete.
