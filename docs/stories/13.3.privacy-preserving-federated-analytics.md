# Story 13.3: Privacy-Preserving Federated Analytics

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** privacy-conscious organization  
**I want** to contribute to and benefit from collective intelligence without exposing sensitive data  
**So that** we can participate in the knowledge economy while maintaining competitive advantage and privacy

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Zero raw data sharing with 100% federated summarization and privacy protection
2. Differential privacy implementation preventing individual organization identification
3. Opt-in controls allowing organizations to customize participation levels and data sharing
4. Competitive safeguards preventing strategic intelligence leakage and advantage erosion
5. Federated summarization with no raw data sharing between organizations
6. Pseudonymized patterns with anonymized, aggregated insights only
7. Cross-organizational learning without data exposure using advanced cryptographic methods
