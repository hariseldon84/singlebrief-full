# Story 12.3: Autonomous AI Query Agent ("Scout") for Proactive Intelligence

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As an** organizational leader  
**I want** proactive AI agents that monitor signals and autonomously generate strategic queries  
**So that** I can surface issues and opportunities before they become critical

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Autonomous monitoring with proactive issue detection and early warning systems
2. Context-aware query generation based on organizational signals and pattern recognition
3. Role-specific agent behavior for managers, leads, and departments with customized intelligence
4. Strategic pattern learning adapted to individual leadership styles and priorities
5. Project Health Scout with milestone monitoring and risk signal detection
6. Team Dynamics Scout analyzing collaboration patterns and expertise utilization
7. Proactive signal detection monitoring calendar patterns, task velocity, and team mood

## Dev Notes

### Autonomous Agent Architecture
Proactive intelligence with specialized scout capabilities:
- **Signal Detection**: Multi-source monitoring with pattern recognition (30%)
- **Query Generation**: Context-aware strategic question creation (25%)
- **Learning Adaptation**: Individual and organizational pattern learning (20%)
- **Role Specialization**: Customized behavior for different leadership levels (15%)
- **Proactive Intervention**: Early warning and recommendation systems (10%)

### Performance Requirements
- Signal detection: <2 minutes for critical issue identification and alert generation
- Query generation: 90%+ relevance rate for autonomously generated strategic queries
- Pattern learning: Measurable improvement in query relevance based on leadership feedback
- Role adaptation: 95%+ satisfaction rate with role-specific agent behavior customization
