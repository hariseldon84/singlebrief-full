## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Based on the available architecture documentation, the following technical specifications apply:

#### Technology Stack
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Next.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI (chosen over Node.js for AI/ML integration)
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 + Role-based access control
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL + S3 + Redis
- **Vector Database**: Weaviate or Pinecone (for future Memory Engine)
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI/Claude + RAG pipelines
- **Hosting**: Vercel (Frontend) + AWS/GCP (Backend)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + Docker
- **Monitoring**: Sentry, Datadog, Prometheus

#### Privacy-by-Design Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/3-privacy-by-design-principles.md]
- Every data access must be scoped, logged, and consented
- Team members control what's shared vs. kept local
- Memory features must be toggleable, resettable, and exportable
- Enterprise Admin Portal required for compliance & policy

#### Missing Architecture Documentation
No specific guidance found in architecture docs for:
- Detailed project structure guidelines (unified-project-structure.md missing)
- Coding standards and conventions (coding-standards.md missing)
- Detailed testing strategy (testing-strategy.md missing)
- Source tree organization (source-tree.md missing)

#### Project Structure Notes
Since unified-project-structure.md doesn't exist yet, this story will establish the foundational structure that other stories will build upon. The structure should accommodate:
- Core modules: Orchestrator Agent, Memory Engine, Team Comms Crawler, Synthesizer Engine, Daily Brief Generator
- Supporting systems: Consent & Privacy Layer, Integration Hub, Trust Layer, Feedback Engine
- Frontend dashboard and UI components

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: No specific testing strategy document found in architecture docs. This story will establish:
- Backend testing with pytest and coverage reporting
- Frontend testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- Integration testing framework
- Test database configuration
- CI/CD automated testing pipeline
