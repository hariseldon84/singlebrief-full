## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Based on the available architecture documentation, the following technical specifications apply:

#### Technology Stack
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Next.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI (chosen over Node.js for AI/ML integration)
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 + Role-based access control
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL + S3 + Redis
- **Vector Database**: Weaviate or Pinecone (for future Memory Engine)
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI/Claude + RAG pipelines
- **Hosting**: Vercel (Frontend) + AWS/GCP (Backend)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + Docker
- **Monitoring**: Sentry, Datadog, Prometheus

#### Privacy-by-Design Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/3-privacy-by-design-principles.md]
- Every data access must be scoped, logged, and consented
- Team members control what's shared vs. kept local
- Memory features must be toggleable, resettable, and exportable
- Enterprise Admin Portal required for compliance & policy

#### Missing Architecture Documentation
No specific guidance found in architecture docs for:
- Detailed project structure guidelines (unified-project-structure.md missing)
- Coding standards and conventions (coding-standards.md missing)
- Detailed testing strategy (testing-strategy.md missing)
- Source tree organization (source-tree.md missing)

#### Project Structure Notes
Since unified-project-structure.md doesn't exist yet, this story will establish the foundational structure that other stories will build upon. The structure should accommodate:
- Core modules: Orchestrator Agent, Memory Engine, Team Comms Crawler, Synthesizer Engine, Daily Brief Generator
- Supporting systems: Consent & Privacy Layer, Integration Hub, Trust Layer, Feedback Engine
- Frontend dashboard and UI components

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: No specific testing strategy document found in architecture docs. This story will establish:
- Backend testing with pytest and coverage reporting
- Frontend testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- Integration testing framework
- Test database configuration
- CI/CD automated testing pipeline

- Strong typing with TypeScript and Pydantic
- Well-structured project organization
- Modern framework usage following best practices

**Areas for Improvement:**
- The missing architecture documentation noted in the dev notes has been partially addressed (coding-standards.md and source-tree.md created), but unified-project-structure.md and testing-strategy.md still need to be created
- Consider adding more comprehensive test examples across both frontend and backend
- API error handling standards could be more clearly documented

### Security Assessment
- Environment variable management follows security best practices
- Secret handling properly implemented
- Docker security configurations are in place

### Testing Assessment
- Test coverage thresholds are appropriate (70%)
- Test structure follows industry best practices
- More comprehensive end-to-end tests could be beneficial

### Final Verdict
Story 1.1 has been successfully implemented with all acceptance criteria met. The foundation for the project has been well established with proper architecture, configuration, and development environment. The project is ready for further development of features in subsequent stories.

**Status:** Ready for deployment ✅
