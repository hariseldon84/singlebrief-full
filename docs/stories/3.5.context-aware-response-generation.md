# Story 3.5: Context-Aware Response Generation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user  
**I want** responses that consider my history and preferences  
**So that** I get more relevant and personalized intelligence

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Historical context integration in responses
2. Preference-based response formatting
3. Proactive suggestion based on patterns
4. Context-sensitive follow-up questions
5. Adaptive response complexity based on user expertise
6. Memory-informed query interpretation
7. Personalized briefing content selection
