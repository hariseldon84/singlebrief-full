# Story 3.2: User Preference Learning

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** manager  
**I want** SingleBrief to learn my preferences and communication style  
**So that** responses become more personalized and relevant over time

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Communication style preference detection
2. Topic interest and priority learning
3. Response format preference adaptation
4. Frequency and timing preference tracking
5. Feedback incorporation for continuous learning
6. Preference confidence scoring
7. Preference override and manual adjustment

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/1-core-modules.md]
User Preference Learning integrates with Memory Engine for "Long-term user-specific + team-level memory storage" and supports personalization across all modules.

### Testing Standards
Preference learning accuracy tests, adaptation speed tests, feedback integration tests, privacy compliance tests
