## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Next.js for response viewing interface with advanced filtering
- **Backend**: FastAPI for response retrieval and analytics APIs
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for response storage with full-text search
- **Analytics**: Statistical analysis for sentiment and pattern recognition

### Response Transparency Requirements
[Source: docs/prd/epic-7-collaborative-team-intelligence.md]
The Raw Team Response Viewer provides "transparency through raw response viewing capabilities" and enables "individual team member response display alongside AI synthesis"

### Integration Points
Must work with:
- Email Response Collection (Story 7.3) for raw response data
- Team Member Profile Management (Story 7.1) for team member attribution
- Real-Time Query Access (Story 7.6) for permission-based viewing
- Trust Layer for confidence scoring and sentiment analysis
- Memory Engine for response history and patterns

### Data Privacy Considerations
- Response-level privacy controls and access management
- Anonymization capabilities for sensitive feedback
- Audit logging for response viewing and access
- GDPR compliance for response data handling

### Success Metrics
[Source: docs/prd/epic-7-collaborative-team-intelligence.md]
- User satisfaction with transparency: 90%+ positive feedback on raw response access
- Response analysis usage: 70%+ users regularly access individual responses
- Privacy compliance: 100% adherence to confidentiality requirements

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: Response display accuracy, filtering and search functionality, export format validation, privacy controls, analytics accuracy, performance with large response sets
