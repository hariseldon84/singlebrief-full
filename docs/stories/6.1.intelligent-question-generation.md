# Story 6.1: Intelligent Question Generation

## Status
Under QA

## Story
**As a** team lead  
**I want** the AI to generate appropriate questions for my team members  
**So that** I can get specific insights without crafting individual queries myself

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Role-based question generation for different team members
2. Context-aware questioning based on current projects and expertise
3. Question complexity adaptation based on recipient background
4. Multi-choice, open-ended, and scale question support
5. Question templates for common scenarios
6. Follow-up question generation based on initial responses
7. Question quality scoring and optimization

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI/Claude for intelligent question generation
- **Backend**: FastAPI for question generation APIs
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL for question templates and effectiveness data

### Team Interrogation AI Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/1-core-modules.md]
The Team Interrogation AI "Actively queries team members for responses to a lead's question" and "Uses adaptive tone, memory, and context"

### Integration Points
Must work with:
- Memory Engine for team member history and preferences
- Data Streams for project and context information
- Synthesizer Engine for response analysis
- Trust Layer for response confidence scoring

### Success Metrics
[Source: docs/prd/6-success-metrics-kpis.md]
- Team Response Compliance target: 85% response rate to agent prompts
- Questions must feel natural and valuable to team members

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: Question generation quality tests, role-based testing, context accuracy tests, follow-up logic tests, effectiveness measurement
