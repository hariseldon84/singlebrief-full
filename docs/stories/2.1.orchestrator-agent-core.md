# Story 2.1: Orchestrator Agent Core Framework

## Status
Under QA

## Story
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** a central orchestrator agent that can receive and coordinate intelligence gathering  
**So that** user queries are processed efficiently across all data sources

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Orchestrator Agent class with query parsing capabilities
2. Intent recognition and classification system
3. Module routing and coordination framework
4. Task queue integration for async processing
5. Error handling and fallback mechanisms
6. Basic query validation and preprocessing
7. Response aggregation and formatting

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Core Orchestrator Agent Architecture (AC: 1, 3)
  - [x] Create OrchestratorAgent base class with plugin architecture
  - [x] Implement query parsing and normalization
  - [x] Design module registry and routing system
  - [x] Create coordination interface for all SingleBrief modules
- [x] Task 2: Intent Recognition System (AC: 2)
  - [x] Implement natural language intent classification
  - [x] Create intent categories (question, command, search, etc.)
  - [x] Build confidence scoring for intent recognition
  - [x] Add intent routing logic to appropriate modules
- [x] Task 3: Async Processing and Task Queue (AC: 4)
  - [x] Integrate Celery for background task processing
  - [x] Create task definitions for different query types
  - [x] Implement task priority and scheduling
  - [x] Add task status tracking and monitoring
- [x] Task 4: Error Handling and Resilience (AC: 5)
  - [x] Create comprehensive error handling framework
  - [x] Implement fallback mechanisms for module failures
  - [x] Add circuit breaker pattern for external services
  - [x] Create error classification and recovery strategies
- [x] Task 5: Query Processing Pipeline (AC: 6, 7)
  - [x] Build query validation and sanitization
  - [x] Implement preprocessing for different query types
  - [x] Create response aggregation and synthesis logic
  - [x] Add response formatting and standardization

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Based on the available architecture documentation:

#### Core Technology Stack
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI for high-performance async processing
- **Task Queue**: Celery for background processing
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI/Claude APIs
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL for persistent data, Redis for caching

#### System Integration Points
[Source: docs/architecture/1-core-modules.md]
The Orchestrator Agent serves as the "Brain of the system that receives queries and decides what intel to gather from where" and must coordinate with:
- Team Comms Crawler for communication data
- Memory Engine for persistent context
- Synthesizer Engine for response generation
- Trust Layer for confidence scoring
- Integration Hub for external data sources

#### Privacy and Security Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/3-privacy-by-design-principles.md]
- All data access must be scoped, logged, and consented
- Query processing must respect user permissions and privacy settings
- Audit trails required for all orchestration decisions

#### Performance Requirements
[Source: docs/prd/6-success-metrics-kpis.md]
- Average Brief Response Time target: <3 seconds
- System must handle concurrent queries efficiently
- Task queue must support high-throughput processing

### Missing Architecture Documentation
No specific guidance found in architecture docs for:
- Detailed orchestrator design patterns
- Specific intent classification schemas
- Task queue configuration standards
- Error handling patterns

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: Based on foundation infrastructure setup:
- Unit tests with pytest for all orchestrator components
- Integration tests for module coordination
- Performance tests for response time requirements
- Load testing for concurrent query handling
- Mock integrations for external service testing
