## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story creates the organizational knowledge foundation that supports:
- Query Templates (Story 8.4) by providing proven response patterns
- Team Intelligence Analytics (Story 8.5) through knowledge usage analytics
- Cross-Team Intelligence (Story 8.6) via shared organizational knowledge
- Daily Brief Generator (Epic 5) through knowledge base integration

### Technical Dependencies
- Natural language processing for question similarity detection and topic clustering
- Machine learning pipeline for response quality assessment and content ranking
- Search engine infrastructure for semantic knowledge retrieval
- Content management system for knowledge organization and maintenance

### FAQ Generation Algorithm
The system identifies FAQ candidates through multiple signals:
- **Question Frequency**: Queries asked 3+ times within 30 days (40% weight)
- **Response Quality**: High-quality answers with positive feedback (30% weight)
- **Topic Clustering**: Questions that cluster around common themes (20% weight)
- **Expert Involvement**: Responses from recognized subject matter experts (10% weight)

### Response Quality Metrics
The quality assessment engine evaluates responses across multiple dimensions:
- **Completeness**: Comprehensive coverage of question intent (25%)
- **Accuracy**: Factual correctness and current information (25%)
- **Clarity**: Clear, understandable communication (20%)
- **Usefulness**: Practical applicability and actionability (15%)
- **Timeliness**: Response speed and relevance to urgency (15%)

### Knowledge Categories
The system organizes knowledge across organizational domains:
- **Process Knowledge**: Procedures, workflows, and operational guidance
- **Technical Knowledge**: Technical specifications, troubleshooting, and how-to guides
- **Business Knowledge**: Policies, strategies, and business context
- **Cultural Knowledge**: Organizational values, norms, and informal practices
- **Project Knowledge**: Project-specific information and lessons learned

### Content Lifecycle Management
Knowledge base content follows a managed lifecycle:
1. **Creation**: Automatic generation from high-quality query/response pairs
2. **Review**: Expert validation and approval for knowledge base inclusion
3. **Publication**: Live knowledge base integration with search indexing
4. **Maintenance**: Regular relevance validation and accuracy verification
5. **Update**: Content revision based on new information or feedback
6. **Archive**: Deprecation of outdated content with historical preservation

### Performance Requirements
- FAQ detection processing: Daily analysis of query patterns with <30 minutes completion
- Knowledge base search: <200ms response time for semantic search queries
- Content quality assessment: <60s processing time for response evaluation
- Knowledge base size: Support for 10,000+ FAQ entries with efficient retrieval
