2. Role-based access to team memories
3. Decision consensus tracking and attribution
4. Team interaction pattern analysis
5. Collaborative context building
6. Team memory privacy controls
7. Cross-team memory sharing permissions

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/3-privacy-by-design-principles.md]
- Team members control what's shared with lead vs. kept local
- Enterprise Admin Portal for compliance & policy

### Testing Standards
Team memory access tests, consensus tracking tests, privacy control tests, cross-team sharing tests
