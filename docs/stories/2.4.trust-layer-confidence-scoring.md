# Story 2.4: Trust Layer and Confidence Scoring

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** manager  
**I want** to see confidence scores and source attribution for all responses  
**So that** I can trust the information and validate it if needed

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Confidence scoring algorithm for AI responses
2. Source reliability and freshness scoring
3. Uncertainty quantification and communication
4. Source attribution with clickable references
5. Raw data toggle for transparency
6. Confidence threshold configuration
7. Audit trail for all confidence calculations

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/1-core-modules.md]
The Trust Layer "Explains confidence scores, source trace, and enables raw data view" using "Custom scoring logic + source metadata" and provides transparency for:
- **Synthesizer Engine**: Confidence scoring for synthesized responses
- **Daily Brief Generator**: Trust indicators for brief content
- **Memory Engine**: Reliability scoring for stored information
- **Team Interrogation AI**: Confidence in team response synthesis

### Testing Standards
Algorithm accuracy tests, confidence calibration tests, source attribution tests, transparency feature tests, audit trail validation tests
