# Story 13.1: Global Pulse Brief - Cross-Organizational Hive Mind

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As an** organizational leader  
**I want** access to anonymized industry-wide intelligence patterns and trends  
**So that** I can benchmark our organization and learn from collective patterns without exposing sensitive data

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Anonymized trend analysis across 500+ participating organizations with privacy protection
2. Industry benchmarking with privacy-preserving comparative analytics and insights
3. Early warning system detecting emerging organizational challenges with 3-6 month advance notice
4. Zero exposure of sensitive organizational data while enabling meaningful insights
5. Cross-organizational pattern analysis with anonymized pattern aggregation and intelligence
6. Industry sentiment mapping with real-time pulse across sectors and geographic regions
7. Federated learning network with privacy-preserving analytics and differential privacy
