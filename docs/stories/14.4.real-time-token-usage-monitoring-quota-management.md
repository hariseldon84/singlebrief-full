# Story 14.4: Real-Time Token Usage Monitoring and Quota Management

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** SingleBrief operations administrator  
**I want** comprehensive monitoring of AI token usage across all client organizations  
**So that** I can optimize costs, prevent overages, and provide accurate usage-based billing

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Real-time token tracking with <5 second latency across all tenants and services
2. Comprehensive usage analytics with 200+ metrics and KPIs for optimization insights
3. Flexible quota management supporting complex usage hierarchies and client tiers
4. Cost optimization recommendations reducing overall token costs by 25% through intelligence
5. Accurate usage forecasting with 90%+ prediction accuracy for capacity planning
6. Seamless billing integration with detailed usage breakdowns and automated invoicing
7. Proactive alert system for unusual usage patterns and quota threshold monitoring
