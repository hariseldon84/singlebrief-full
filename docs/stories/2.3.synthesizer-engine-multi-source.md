# Story 2.3: Synthesizer Engine for Multi-Source Data

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** manager  
**I want** coherent responses that combine information from multiple sources  
**So that** I get complete answers without information fragmentation

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Multi-source data aggregation and deduplication
2. Contradiction detection and resolution
3. Information prioritization based on source reliability
4. Response structuring and formatting
5. Context preservation across data sources
6. Temporal information handling (recent vs. historical)
7. Source attribution and citation generation

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/1-core-modules.md]
The Synthesizer Engine "Summarizes, deduplicates, and resolves contradictions across sources" using "OpenAI / Claude + RAG pipelines" and integrates with:
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Receives synthesis requests
- **Team Comms Crawler**: Processes communication data
- **Memory Engine**: Incorporates user context and history
- **Trust Layer**: Provides confidence scoring
- **Daily Brief Generator**: Delivers synthesized content

[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI/Claude + RAG pipelines
- **Vector Database**: Weaviate or Pinecone for semantic search
- **Backend**: FastAPI for processing APIs

### Testing Standards
Unit tests for synthesis algorithms, integration tests for multi-source processing, performance tests for large data volumes, accuracy tests for contradiction detection
