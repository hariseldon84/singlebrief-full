- **Teaching Value**: Responses that demonstrate excellent communication principles
- **Anonymization**: Remove identifying information while preserving learning value

### Gamification Elements
The engagement system includes multiple motivation mechanisms:
- **Achievement Badges**: Quality milestones, consistency streaks, improvement rate achievements
- **Progress Levels**: Communication skill levels with clear advancement criteria
- **Team Challenges**: Collaborative quality improvement goals and competitions
- **Recognition System**: Public recognition for outstanding responses and improvement
- **Learning Paths**: Structured skill development paths with guided progression

### Performance Requirements
- Real-time quality analysis: <300ms for quality scoring and improvement suggestions
- Coaching personalization: 95%+ relevance rate for individual coaching suggestions
- Best practice curation: 90%+ community approval rate for shared examples
- Progress tracking: Real-time updates with weekly trend analysis and reporting
- Gamification engagement: 80%+ user participation rate in quality improvement activities
