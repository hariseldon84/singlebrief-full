# Story 8.3: Intelligent Query Decomposition and Multi-Routing

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** query creator  
**I want** the AI to automatically break down complex queries into targeted sub-queries  
**So that** I can get comprehensive coverage from the most appropriate experts for each aspect

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Automatic query breakdown system that identifies multiple domains and sub-topics
2. Dependency mapping between sub-queries to ensure proper sequencing and coordination
3. Expert-optimized distribution patterns (e.g., 3-2-2-1-2 routing) based on query complexity
4. Response synthesis engine that combines multiple expert inputs into coherent intelligence
5. Parallel problem-solving coordination that manages timing and dependencies
6. Quality assurance for decomposed queries to ensure comprehensive coverage
7. Fallback handling for partial responses or expert unavailability

  - [ ] Build natural language processing for query analysis

  - [ ] Design multi-response synthesis algorithms
  - [ ] Implement conflict resolution for contradicting inputs
  - [ ] Create coherent response generation from multiple sources
  - [ ] Build quality scoring for synthesized responses
- [ ] Task 5: Coordination and Quality Control (AC: 5, 6, 7)

  - [ ] Create comprehensive coverage validation
  - [ ] Build fallback mechanisms for missing responses
  - [ ] Add timing optimization and deadline management

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story extends Smart Query Routing (Story 8.2) and integrates with:
- AI Conversation Memory (Story 8.1) for context preservation across sub-queries
- Synthesizer Engine (Epic 4) for multi-response synthesis and deduplication
- Team Interrogation AI (Epic 6) for coordinated multi-expert engagement

### Technical Dependencies
- Advanced natural language processing for query decomposition and analysis
- Coordination engine for parallel processing and dependency management
- Machine learning for pattern optimization and expert selection
- Real-time communication system for coordinated expert engagement

### Query Decomposition Algorithm
The system uses a multi-stage approach:
1. **Domain Analysis**: Identify distinct knowledge domains in the query (30s)
2. **Sub-query Generation**: Create targeted questions for each domain (20s)
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Identify prerequisite relationships between sub-queries (15s)
4. **Expert Matching**: Select optimal experts for each sub-query (10s)
5. **Coordination**: Sequence and coordinate expert engagement (ongoing)

### Distribution Patterns
Common routing patterns based on query complexity:
- **Simple Multi-domain (3-2-1)**: 3 experts for main topic, 2 for secondary, 1 for tertiary
- **Complex Balanced (3-3-2-2)**: Balanced distribution for equally important domains
- **Hierarchical (5-2-2-1)**: Primary domain gets most experts, others support
- **Specialist Focus (2-2-2-2-2)**: Equal distribution to domain specialists

### Performance Requirements
- Query decomposition time: <30s for complex multi-domain queries
- Coordination overhead: <10% additional time compared to single routing
- Coverage accuracy: 90%+ comprehensive coverage of original query intent
- Synthesis quality: 85%+ coherence score for multi-response synthesis
