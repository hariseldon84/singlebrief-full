- **Collaborative Responses**: Real-time co-editing for team responses
- **Response Templates**: Saved responses for common question types
- **Structured Responses**: Forms, surveys, and structured data input

**Real-Time Collaboration:**
- **Live Co-Editing**: Multiple team members working on response simultaneously
- **Comment Threads**: Discussion and clarification on responses
- **Approval Workflows**: Review and approval process for sensitive responses
- **Version History**: Track changes and maintain response audit trail

### Notification System
- **Real-Time Delivery**: Instant notifications for new queries
- **Smart Batching**: Group related notifications to reduce interruption
