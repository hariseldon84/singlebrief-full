# Story 7.7: Predefined Team Groups Management

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user creating queries  
**I want** to create and manage predefined groups of team members

2. Multiple group types support (direct reports, project teams, cross-functional, custom)
3. Drag-and-drop team member assignment to groups with bulk operations
4. Group templates and quick setup options for common organizational patterns
5. Group hierarchy and nested group support (groups within groups)
6. Group sharing and collaboration with other users
7. Smart group suggestions based on usage patterns and team relationships
8. Group analytics and usage tracking for optimization

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Next.js for group management interface with drag-and-drop capabilities
- **Backend**: FastAPI for group management and analytics APIs
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for group relationships and hierarchy storage
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI/Claude for smart group suggestions and optimization

### Team Group Requirements
This addresses the user need for "predefined groups of team members as pre-defined ones" and enables "particular group of users that he needs to ask again and again" functionality for improved workflow efficiency.

### Integration Points
Must work with:
- Team Member Profile Management (Story 7.1) for member data and relationships
- Interactive Query Builder (Story 7.2) for group selection in query creation
- Real-Time Query Access (Story 7.6) for group-based permission management
- Memory Engine for group usage patterns and optimization
- Orchestrator Agent for AI-powered group suggestions

### Group Types and Use Cases
**Direct Reports Group:**
- Automatically populated based on organizational hierarchy
- Manager can quickly query all direct reports
- Supports delegation and status update queries

**Project Team Groups:**
- Cross-functional teams working on specific projects
- Temporary groups with defined project lifecycle
- Integration with project management tools

**Cross-Functional Groups:**
- Department representatives (DevOps, Legal, Frontend, Marketing)
- Subject matter expert groups based on expertise tags
- Standing committees and working groups

**Custom Groups:**
- User-defined groups for specific purposes
- Ad-hoc teams for special initiatives
- Flexible grouping based on any criteria

### Group Hierarchy Examples
```
Engineering Department
├── Frontend Team
│   ├── React Developers
│   └── UI/UX Designers
├── Backend Team
│   ├── API Developers
│   └── DevOps Engineers
└── QA Team
    ├── Manual Testers
    └── Automation Engineers
```

### Success Metrics
- Group creation rate: 80%+ users create at least one predefined group
- Group usage rate: 70%+ queries use predefined groups vs. manual selection
- Time savings: 60% reduction in team member selection time
- Group effectiveness: 85%+ user satisfaction with group-based querying

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: Group creation and management tests, member assignment accuracy, hierarchy relationship validation, sharing and permissions tests, smart suggestion accuracy, analytics and reporting functionality
