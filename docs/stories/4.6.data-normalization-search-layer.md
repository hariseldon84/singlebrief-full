## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Code (Sonnet 4) - Development Agent

### Implementation Status
Story 4.6 Data Normalization and Search Layer has been fully implemented with comprehensive unified data schema, full-text search, and content management capabilities.

**âœ… COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION:**

**Core Service (`backend/app/services/data_normalization.py`):**
- Unified data schema with UnifiedDataItem class supporting all source types
- Data normalization for Slack, Email, Documents, GitHub, and Jira sources
- Content classification with automatic categorization and tagging
- Duplicate detection using content similarity algorithms
- Data freshness tracking and staleness management
- Search relevance scoring with freshness, quality, and content factors
- Elasticsearch/OpenSearch integration for full-text search
- Bulk processing capabilities for large data sets
- Comprehensive metadata preservation and source attribution

**API Endpoints (`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/search.py`):**
- `/search/query` - Unified search across all integrated data sources
- `/search/normalize` - Single item data normalization to unified format
- `/search/normalize-bulk` - Bulk data normalization with batch processing
- `/search/stats` - Comprehensive search and data statistics
- `/search/reindex` - Reindex data from sources with cleanup capabilities
- `/search/content-types` - Available content types for filtering
