# Story 2.5: Query Processing Optimization

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user  
**I want** fast response times even for complex queries  
**So that** SingleBrief feels responsive and efficient

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Query complexity assessment and routing
2. Parallel processing for independent data sources
3. Caching strategy for frequently asked questions
4. Response time monitoring and alerting
5. Query optimization and rewriting
6. Progressive response delivery (streaming)
7. Performance metrics dashboard
