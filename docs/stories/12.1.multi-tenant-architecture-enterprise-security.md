## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story establishes enterprise multi-tenant foundation and integrates with:
- Organizational Intelligence Graph (Story 12.2) for tenant-specific intelligence mapping
- Autonomous AI Agents (Story 12.3) for tenant-aware proactive intelligence
- Scalable Infrastructure (Story 12.4) for performance optimization across tenants
- Cross-Tenant Collaboration (Story 12.5) for secure partnership management

### Technical Dependencies
- Multi-tenant database architecture with complete isolation and security
- Enterprise security framework with SOC 2 compliance and audit capabilities
- Scalable cloud infrastructure with auto-scaling and performance optimization
- White-label deployment system with custom branding and domain management

### Multi-Tenant Security Architecture
Complete data isolation with enterprise-grade security:
- **Database Isolation**: Separate databases per tenant with encrypted connections (40%)
- **Application Isolation**: Tenant-specific application instances with resource boundaries (25%)
- **Network Isolation**: Virtual private networks with secure tenant communication (20%)
- **Authentication Isolation**: Tenant-specific auth systems with enterprise SSO integration (10%)
- **Audit Isolation**: Separate audit trails with immutable logging per tenant (5%)

### Scalability Framework
Infrastructure supporting thousands of organizations:
- **Auto-Scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on tenant usage patterns
- **Load Distribution**: Intelligent tenant distribution across infrastructure zones
- **Performance Isolation**: Resource boundaries preventing tenant interference
- **Capacity Planning**: Predictive scaling based on tenant growth and usage analytics

### White-Label Deployment System
Enterprise branding and customization capabilities:
- **Theme Management**: Real-time branding updates with custom CSS and assets
- **Domain Management**: Custom domain setup with automated SSL certificate provisioning
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Tenant-specific feature flags and customization options
- **Deployment Automation**: Zero-downtime deployment with gradual rollout capabilities

### Performance Requirements
- Multi-tenant isolation: 100% data separation with zero cross-tenant data leakage
- Scalability: Support 1000+ tenants with <200ms response time per tenant
- Security: SOC 2 compliance with 99.9% audit trail completeness
- White-label: <4 hours for complete custom branding deployment
- Uptime: 99.9% availability across all tenants with automated failover
