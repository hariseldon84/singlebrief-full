# Story 8.2: Smart Query Routing with Dynamic Expertise Scoring

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** query creator  
**I want** the AI to automatically route queries to team members who provide the most helpful responses for specific topics  
**So that** I get higher quality responses and optimal use of team expertise

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Response quality scoring system with multi-dimensional metrics (helpfulness, accuracy, timeliness)
2. Dynamic expertise tracking that evolves based on response patterns and outcomes
3. Topic-specific routing with confidence indicators for optimal expert selection
4. Visual expertise maps showing team knowledge distribution and capabilities
5. Routing system integration that enhances or replaces current query distribution
6. Feedback loop system that continuously improves routing accuracy
7. Fallback mechanisms when primary experts are unavailable

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story builds on the foundational Team Interrogation AI (Epic 6) and integrates with:
- AI Conversation Memory (Story 8.1) for historical response quality data
- Team Intelligence Platform (Epic 7) for team member profiles and capabilities
- Synthesizer Engine (Epic 4) for response quality analysis

### Technical Dependencies
- Machine learning pipeline for expertise scoring and routing optimization
- Real-time analytics for routing performance monitoring
- Natural language processing for topic classification and expert matching
- Database systems for expertise tracking and historical analysis

### Routing Algorithm Design
The smart routing system uses a multi-factor scoring approach:
- **Historical Performance**: Response quality scores for specific topics (40%)
- **Availability Patterns**: Team member response time and availability (25%)
- **Topic Expertise**: Domain knowledge and experience indicators (20%)
- **Recency Bias**: Recent performance weighted higher than historical (10%)
- **Diversity Factor**: Prevents over-routing to single experts (5%)

### Integration Strategy
This system can operate in two modes:
- **Enhancement Mode**: Improves existing routing with AI recommendations
- **Replacement Mode**: Full AI-driven routing based on expertise scoring

### Performance Requirements
- Routing decision time: <50ms for query classification and expert selection
- Expertise scoring: Real-time updates with <100ms latency
- Routing accuracy: 80%+ improvement over current random/manual routing
- System scalability: Support for 1,000+ team members per organization
