## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story provides C-level organizational intelligence and integrates with:
- Advanced Analytics (Story 11.3) for strategic business intelligence coordination
- Memory-Driven Follow-ups (Story 11.5) for recursive intelligence pattern recognition
- Emotional Intelligence Layer (Story 10.4) for comprehensive organizational sentiment
- Organizational Intelligence Platform for knowledge base and strategic decision support

### Technical Dependencies
- Real-time dashboard architecture with executive-level visualization capabilities
- Advanced analytics engine for organizational intelligence measurement and pattern recognition
- Integration framework for strategic planning, board reporting, and executive communication systems
- Machine learning pipeline for organizational consciousness assessment and optimization recommendations

### Organizational Consciousness Framework
The system measures organizational intelligence across multiple consciousness dimensions:
- **Cognitive Health**: Collective decision-making quality, learning velocity, and intellectual capacity (30%)
- **Knowledge Circulation**: Information flow efficiency, expertise utilization, and knowledge sharing effectiveness (25%)
- **Decision Intelligence**: Decision velocity, quality, and alignment with strategic objectives (20%)
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Organizational sentiment, cultural health, and psychological safety indicators (15%)
- **Adaptive Capacity**: Change responsiveness, innovation capability, and resilience metrics (10%)

### Decision Velocity Intelligence
The system tracks and optimizes organizational decision-making processes:
- **Decision Pipeline**: Visual representation of decisions at different stages (identification, analysis, approval, implementation)
- **Velocity Measurement**: Time from decision identification to implementation with bottleneck analysis
- **Quality Correlation**: Relationship between decision speed and outcome quality with optimization insights
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Decision consensus measurement with conflict resolution effectiveness
- **Implementation Success**: Decision execution quality with learning loop integration

### Knowledge Network Architecture
The system maps and optimizes organizational knowledge assets:
- **Expertise Topology**: Visual mapping of knowledge distribution across organizational structure
- **Knowledge Flows**: Dynamic visualization of information movement and utilization patterns
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Identification of knowledge constraints with bridge-building recommendations
- **Utilization Optimization**: Recommendations for better expertise allocation and knowledge sharing
- **Intellectual Capital**: Valuation and growth tracking of organizational knowledge assets

### Real-Time Dashboard Components
The executive dashboard provides comprehensive organizational consciousness visibility:
- **Executive Summary**: Single-page overview of organizational intelligence health with trend indicators
- **Decision Command Center**: Real-time decision tracking with priority and impact assessment
- **Knowledge Network View**: Interactive expertise mapping with utilization and flow analysis
- **Sentiment Heat Map**: Organizational mood visualization with department and team granularity
- **Strategic Alignment**: OKR progress correlation with organizational consciousness metrics

### Strategic Planning Integration
The system seamlessly integrates with executive strategic planning processes:
- **OKR Correlation**: Organizational consciousness alignment with objectives and key results
- **Strategic Initiative Tracking**: Consciousness impact on strategic project success and progress
- **Board Reporting**: Executive-level summaries suitable for board meetings and governance
- **Investor Intelligence**: Organizational consciousness insights for investor and stakeholder communication
- **Strategic Decision Support**: Consciousness-informed recommendations for strategic planning and execution

### Organizational Sentiment Intelligence
The system provides comprehensive organizational mood and cultural health insights:
- **Sentiment Mapping**: Geographic and hierarchical visualization of organizational mood patterns
- **Cultural Health Indicators**: Psychological safety, engagement, and satisfaction metrics with trend analysis
- **Risk Assessment**: Early warning systems for cultural issues, conflicts, and engagement problems
- **Improvement Correlation**: Relationship between sentiment improvements and business outcomes
- **Intervention Recommendations**: Data-driven suggestions for cultural and engagement improvement

### Performance Requirements
- Real-time updates: <30 second refresh rate for all organizational consciousness metrics
