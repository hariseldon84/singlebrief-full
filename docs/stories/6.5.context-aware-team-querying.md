## Acceptance Criteria
1. Team structure and relationship mapping
2. Expertise and knowledge area identification
3. Workload and availability consideration
4. Recent interaction history awareness
5. Project and deadline context integration
6. Skip logic for irrelevant team members
7. Escalation and delegation query routing
