## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Code (Sonnet 4) - Development Agent

### Implementation Status
Story 4.3 Email and Calendar Integration has been fully implemented with comprehensive service layer and API endpoints for both Gmail/Google Calendar and Outlook/Microsoft Calendar.

**âœ… COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION:**

**Core Service (`backend/app/integrations/email_calendar_integration.py`):**
- OAuth 2.0 flows for both Gmail and Outlook with secure token management
- Email message retrieval with search, filtering, and body content parsing
- Calendar event access with date range filtering and recurring event support
- Thread analysis with participant tracking and context extraction
- Contact relationship mapping with communication frequency analysis
- Email priority scoring algorithms with sender authority and topic relevance
- Calendar availability analysis with conflict detection and scheduling optimization
- Comprehensive error handling and operation logging

**API Endpoints (`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/email_calendar.py`):**
- `/email-calendar/setup` - Configure Gmail or Outlook integration
- `/email-calendar/oauth/initiate` - Start OAuth flow for email/calendar access
- `/email-calendar/oauth/complete` - Complete OAuth and store encrypted tokens
- `/email-calendar/emails` - Fetch emails with search and filtering options
- `/email-calendar/calendar` - Retrieve calendar events with date range filtering
- `/email-calendar/thread/analyze` - Analyze email threads for context and insights
