## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story ensures organizational accountability and integrates with:
- Decision Tracking and Outcome Management (Story 8.8) for escalation outcome correlation
- Query-Driven Business Metrics (Story 8.7) for organizational health monitoring
- Team Intelligence Analytics (Story 8.5) for escalation pattern analysis
- Cross-Team Intelligence (Story 8.6) for cross-departmental escalation management

### Technical Dependencies
- Organizational hierarchy integration with HR systems and directory services
- Rule engine infrastructure for escalation logic and trigger management
- Multi-channel notification system for escalation communication
- Analytics platform for escalation effectiveness measurement and optimization

### Escalation Trigger Algorithm
The system uses multiple factors to determine escalation necessity and timing:
- **Response Delay**: Time since query submission without adequate response (40% weight)
- **Urgency Level**: User-defined or AI-assessed query urgency (25% weight)
- **Issue Severity**: Business impact and organizational risk assessment (20% weight)
- **Historical Patterns**: Previous escalation success and timing optimization (10% weight)
- **Resource Availability**: Target responder availability and workload (5% weight)

### Organizational Hierarchy Mapping
The system models organizational structure across multiple dimensions:
- **Functional Hierarchy**: Direct reporting relationships and management structure
- **Expertise Hierarchy**: Subject matter experts and domain authority
- **Project Hierarchy**: Project-specific authority and decision-making power
- **Emergency Hierarchy**: Crisis response and emergency decision authority
- **Cross-Functional Relationships**: Matrix organization and collaborative authority

### Urgency Classification Framework
Query urgency is assessed through multiple signals:
- **Business Impact**: Revenue, customer, or operational impact severity
- **Time Sensitivity**: Deadline proximity and time-critical decision requirements
- **Stakeholder Impact**: Number and importance of affected stakeholders
- **Risk Level**: Potential negative consequences of delayed response
- **Opportunity Cost**: Value lost through delayed action or decision

### Escalation Pathways
The system supports multiple escalation strategies:
- **Vertical Escalation**: Traditional management hierarchy climbing
- **Horizontal Escalation**: Peer or alternative expert engagement
- **Functional Escalation**: Domain expert or specialist consultation
- **Emergency Escalation**: Crisis response and executive engagement
- **Cross-Functional Escalation**: Multi-department coordination and decision-making

### Performance Requirements
- Escalation decision time: <60s for automatic escalation assessment and triggering
- Hierarchy lookup: <100ms for organizational structure navigation and authority determination
- Notification delivery: <30s for multi-channel escalation communication
- Analytics processing: Daily escalation effectiveness analysis with <15 minute completion
