# Story 12.5: Cross-Tenant Collaboration and Partnership Management

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** business partnership manager  
**I want** controlled cross-tenant collaboration capabilities

2. Complete audit trails for all partnership interactions and cross-organizational data access
3. Secure query routing with identity verification and encrypted communication channels
4. Integration with enterprise identity and access management systems for seamless authentication
5. Cross-tenant query routing with explicit permission controls and approval workflows
6. Partnership-specific data sharing with configurable access levels and time-based permissions
7. Secure collaboration channels with end-to-end encryption and compliance monitoring

## Dev Notes

### Cross-Tenant Security Architecture
Secure collaboration with enterprise-grade controls:
- **Permission Management**: Granular access control with time-based permissions (35%)
- **Audit Compliance**: Complete audit trails with regulatory adherence (25%)
- **Secure Communications**: End-to-end encryption with identity verification (20%)
- **Identity Integration**: Enterprise SSO with multi-factor authentication (15%)
- **Data Classification**: Sensitivity-based sharing with automated policy enforcement (5%)

### Performance Requirements
- Permission validation: <100ms for cross-tenant access permission verification
- Audit logging: 100% completeness with immutable storage and real-time compliance
- Secure routing: <200ms for encrypted cross-tenant query routing and response
- Identity verification: <500ms for enterprise SSO authentication and authorization
