## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/3-privacy-by-design-principles.md]
- Memory can be toggled off, reset, or exported
- Every data access must be scoped, logged, and consented
- Enterprise Admin Portal for compliance & policy

### Testing Standards
Privacy control tests, GDPR compliance tests, data export/import tests, consent management tests, audit trail tests
