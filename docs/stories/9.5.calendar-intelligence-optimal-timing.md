## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story optimizes organizational communication effectiveness and integrates with:
- Team Intelligence Analytics (Story 8.5) for productivity pattern analysis
- Query Templates (Story 8.4) for timing-optimized communication patterns
- Intelligent Escalation (Story 9.4) for urgency-aware timing decisions
- Decision Tracking (Story 8.8) for deadline-aware query scheduling

### Technical Dependencies
- Calendar API integration for major platforms (Google, Microsoft, Apple)
- Machine learning pipeline for productivity pattern recognition and optimization
- Real-time availability tracking and scheduling optimization
- Analytics engine for timing effectiveness measurement and improvement

### Calendar Integration Architecture
The system integrates with multiple calendar platforms:
- **Google Calendar**: OAuth 2.0 integration with availability and meeting detection
- **Microsoft Outlook**: Microsoft Graph API for calendar and availability data
- **Apple Calendar**: CalDAV protocol integration for availability tracking
- **Other Platforms**: Generic calendar integration through standard protocols
- **Unified View**: Aggregated availability across all connected calendar platforms

### Productivity Pattern Recognition
The system identifies individual and team productivity patterns:
- **Peak Performance Hours**: Times of highest response quality and engagement
- **Focus Periods**: Extended deep work sessions requiring protection
- **Meeting Patterns**: Regular meeting schedules and availability windows
- **Response Speed Patterns**: Timing correlation with response speed and quality
- **Workload Cycles**: Busy periods and lighter availability windows

### Timing Optimization Algorithm
The system optimizes query timing through multi-factor analysis:
- **Availability Score**: Calendar-based availability and meeting conflicts (35%)
- **Productivity Score**: Historical response quality and engagement at specific times (30%)
- **Urgency Factor**: Query urgency and deadline-driven timing requirements (20%)
- **Focus Protection**: Respect for deep work periods and focus time (10%)
- **Personal Preference**: Individual timing preferences and customization (5%)

### Focus Time Protection Framework
The system implements intelligent interruption management:
- **Focus Period Detection**: AI identification of extended work sessions and deep focus
- **Interruption Batching**: Grouping non-urgent queries for optimal delivery timing
- **Priority Override**: Urgent queries that can interrupt focus time with user consent
- **Focus Metrics**: Measurement of focus time protection effectiveness and user satisfaction
- **Adaptive Learning**: Improvement of focus detection based on user feedback and patterns

### Timing Categories and Strategies
Different query types receive different timing optimization:
- **Urgent Queries**: Immediate delivery with focus interruption capabilities
- **Routine Updates**: Batched delivery during natural communication windows
- **Creative Requests**: Scheduled during peak creative and problem-solving hours
- **Administrative Tasks**: Delivered during lower-energy administrative time blocks
- **Collaborative Queries**: Coordinated delivery when multiple stakeholders are available

### Performance Requirements
- Calendar sync frequency: 15-minute intervals for availability updates
- Availability calculation: <100ms for real-time availability assessment
- Timing optimization: <200ms for optimal delivery time calculation
- Focus detection accuracy: 90%+ accuracy in identifying deep work periods
