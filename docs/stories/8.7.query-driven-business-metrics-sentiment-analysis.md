## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story transforms organizational communication data into actionable business intelligence:
- Integrates with Team Intelligence Analytics (Story 8.5) for behavioral data
- Uses AI Conversation Memory (Story 8.1) for historical trend analysis
- Connects with Cross-Team Intelligence (Story 8.6) for organizational-wide insights
- Links to Daily Brief Generator (Epic 5) for executive reporting integration

### Technical Dependencies
- Advanced natural language processing for business context understanding
- Machine learning pipeline for sentiment analysis and predictive modeling
- Real-time analytics engine for metric generation and trend analysis
- Business intelligence integration framework for external dashboard connectivity

### Business Metric Categories
The system automatically extracts multiple types of business metrics:
- **Performance Metrics**: Productivity indicators, goal achievement, project progress
- **Quality Metrics**: Error rates, customer satisfaction signals, process efficiency
- **Innovation Metrics**: New ideas, creative solutions, improvement suggestions
- **Collaboration Metrics**: Team cooperation, cross-functional effectiveness, knowledge sharing
- **Engagement Metrics**: Team morale, participation levels, retention indicators
- **Risk Metrics**: Issue escalation, conflict indicators, compliance concerns

### Sentiment Analysis Framework
Multi-dimensional sentiment analysis includes:
- **Emotional Sentiment**: Positive, negative, neutral with confidence scores
- **Engagement Sentiment**: High, medium, low engagement levels
- **Confidence Sentiment**: Certainty, uncertainty, confusion indicators
- **Urgency Sentiment**: Critical, important, routine priority levels
- **Collaboration Sentiment**: Cooperative, conflicting, neutral team dynamics

### Early Warning Indicators
The system monitors for organizational risk patterns:
- **Communication Quality Decline**: Reduced response rates or engagement
- **Sentiment Degradation**: Increasing negative sentiment trends
- **Collaboration Breakdown**: Decreased cross-team or internal cooperation
- **Performance Warning Signs**: Declining productivity or quality indicators
- **Innovation Stagnation**: Reduced creative input or improvement suggestions

### Performance Requirements
- Metric extraction time: <30s for processing team responses into business metrics
- Sentiment analysis: Real-time sentiment scoring with <100ms latency
- Early warning detection: <15 minutes for critical organizational issue identification
- Dashboard updates: Real-time BI integration with <60s data refresh cycles
