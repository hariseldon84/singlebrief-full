## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story extends the routing capabilities from Stories 8.2 and 8.3 to organizational scale:
- Builds on Smart Query Routing for cross-team expert identification
- Integrates with Team Intelligence Analytics (Story 8.5) for organizational insights
- Connects with Consent & Privacy Layer (Epic 5) for permission management
- Links to Organizational Intelligence Platform (Epic 9) for directory integration

### Technical Dependencies
- Multi-tenant permission system for secure cross-team access
- Organizational directory integration (Active Directory, LDAP, Okta)
- Advanced audit logging system for compliance and security
- Graph database for organizational relationship and expertise mapping

### Permission Model
The system implements a multi-layered permission model:
- **Team Level**: Default team boundaries with controlled external access
- **Department Level**: Departmental permissions for cross-functional queries
- **Project Level**: Project-based permissions for collaborative initiatives
- **Individual Level**: Personal permission settings for expertise sharing
- **Organizational Level**: Company-wide policies and compliance requirements

### Knowledge Sharing Categories
Different types of organizational knowledge require different security levels:
- **Public Knowledge**: Openly shareable across all teams (procedures, policies)
- **Internal Knowledge**: Department-restricted information requiring approval
- **Confidential Knowledge**: Sensitive information with strict access controls
- **Project Knowledge**: Project-specific information with team-based access
- **Personal Knowledge**: Individual expertise sharing with opt-in controls

### Security Architecture
Cross-team intelligence sharing implements multiple security layers:
- **Authentication**: SSO integration with organizational identity providers
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with fine-grained permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of all cross-team access and sharing
- **Data Classification**: Automatic and manual data sensitivity classification
- **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive cross-team communications

### Performance Requirements
- Cross-team routing decision time: <100ms with permission validation
- Expertise discovery: Search across 10,000+ employees with <500ms response
- Permission validation: <50ms for access control decisions
- Audit logging: Real-time logging with <10ms overhead per operation
