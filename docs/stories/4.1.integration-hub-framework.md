# Story 4.1: Integration Hub Framework

## Status
Under progress

## Story
**As a** system architect  
**I want** an extensible framework for integrating external services  
**So that** new data sources can be added easily without system redesign

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Plugin architecture for external service connectors
2. Standardized connector interface and API
3. Integration health monitoring and alerting
4. Rate limiting and quota management
5. Error handling and retry mechanisms
6. Integration configuration management
7. Connector versioning and updates

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/1-core-modules.md]
Integration Hub provides "Scalable plug-in system for tools: Slack, Drive, GitHub, Zoom, CRMs, Notion, etc." using "Zapier-like engine + REST adapters"

### Testing Standards
Plugin framework tests, connector interface tests, health monitoring tests, rate limiting tests, error handling tests
