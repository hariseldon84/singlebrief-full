# Story 7.9: Microsoft Teams Response Collection and Integration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** team member using Microsoft Teams with linked SingleBrief account  
**I want** to receive query notifications via 1:1 Teams chat and respond directly within the conversation  
**So that** I can participate in team intelligence privately without leaving my Microsoft 365 workspace

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Microsoft Teams app integration with Azure AD authentication for 1:1 chat messaging only
2. Query delivery via direct 1:1 chat to individual users (no channel/group messaging)
3. In-Teams response collection through 1:1 chat conversations and adaptive cards
4. Real-time response status updates and confirmations within 1:1 chat conversation
5. Azure AD user mapping to SingleBrief team member profiles (from Story 7.1)
6. Response routing from Teams 1:1 chats back to Story 6.3 response orchestration system
7. User-controlled notification preferences for Teams delivery method
8. Teams account verification and linking validation during team member setup

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **Integration**: Microsoft Graph API with Teams SDK and Bot Framework
- **Authentication**: Azure AD with OAuth 2.0 and Microsoft identity platform
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for Teams tenant and user mapping data
- **Queue System**: Celery for asynchronous Teams message processing

### Microsoft Teams Integration Requirements
This implements platform-specific response collection that feeds into **Story 6.3 (Response Collection and Management)** as the central orchestration hub. Teams responses are normalized and routed to the main response processing pipeline with Microsoft 365 context preservation.

### Integration Points
Must work with:
- **Story 6.3**: Response Collection and Management (primary routing destination)
- **Story 6.2**: Adaptive Communication and Tone Management (Teams-specific tone adaptation)
- **Story 7.1**: Team Member Profile Management (Azure AD user mapping)
- **Story 7.2**: Interactive Query Builder (Teams channel selection)
- **Existing Microsoft integrations**: Email and Calendar integration from Epic 4

### Teams-Specific Features

**Query Delivery Options:**
- **Channel Posts**: Team-wide queries with @mention targeting
- **Group Chats**: Multi-person private conversations
- **Direct Messages**: One-on-one private queries
- **Meeting Chats**: Context-aware queries during or after meetings

**Response Collection Methods:**
- **Adaptive Cards**: Rich interactive UI with forms, buttons, and input fields
- **Threaded Replies**: Natural conversation threading within Teams
- **Action Buttons**: Quick response options embedded in cards
- **Task Modules**: Pop-up modals for complex structured responses

### Microsoft Teams App Capabilities
- **Tenant Installation**: Admin-consented app deployment across organization
- **User Identity Integration**: Seamless Azure AD user mapping
- **Channel Configuration**: Granular control over which channels receive queries
- **Presence Integration**: Respect user availability and focus time
- **Activity Feed**: Rich notifications with context and quick actions

### Microsoft 365 Ecosystem Integration
- **Power Platform**: Automated workflows through Power Automate
- **Viva Insights**: Employee experience and engagement data
- **SharePoint**: Document context and collaborative responses
- **Microsoft Planner**: Task creation and tracking from query responses

### Success Metrics
- Teams integration adoption: 85%+ organizations with Teams enable integration
- In-Teams response rate: 78%+ response rate for Teams-delivered queries
- User satisfaction: 87%+ positive feedback on Teams experience
- Microsoft 365 workflow adoption: 40%+ users leverage Power Platform integrations

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: Microsoft Graph API integration tests, Azure AD authentication validation, adaptive card functionality, response collection and parsing, presence integration, multi-tenant support, compliance and security validation
