# Story 6.3: Response Collection and Management

## Status
Under QA

## Story
**As a** system orchestrator  
**I need** platform-agnostic response collection and management  
**So that** team input can be gathered reliably across all platforms and follow-ups managed effectively

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Platform-agnostic response orchestration and normalization hub
2. Response routing from all platforms (Email 7.3, Slack 7.8, Teams 7.9, In-App 7.10)
3. Unified response tracking and status management across platforms
4. Automated follow-up and reminder system with platform-specific delivery
5. Response validation and quality checking with platform context preservation
6. Response aggregation and preparation for Story 6.4 (Insights Synthesis)
7. Integration with Stories 6.2 (Tone Management) for platform-adaptive communication
8. Cross-platform response deduplication and conflict resolution

## Dev Notes
### Updated Architecture Context
**CRITICAL ROLE CHANGE**: Story 6.3 now serves as the **central response orchestration hub** that receives normalized responses from all platform-specific collection stories:

**Platform Integration Architecture**:
- **Story 7.3 (Email)** → normalizes email responses → routes to Story 6.3
- **Story 7.8 (Slack)** → normalizes Slack responses → routes to Story 6.3  
- **Story 7.9 (Teams)** → normalizes Teams responses → routes to Story 6.3
- **Story 7.10 (In-App)** → normalizes in-app responses → routes to Story 6.3

**Story 6.3 Output Integration**:
- **Story 6.2 (Tone Management)** ← receives aggregated response patterns from 6.3
- **Story 6.4 (Insights Synthesis)** ← receives normalized response data from 6.3

### Central Orchestration Responsibilities
1. **Response Normalization**: Convert platform-specific formats to unified response schema
2. **Deduplication**: Handle cases where users respond on multiple platforms
3. **Status Orchestration**: Coordinate response status across all platforms
4. **Quality Validation**: Apply consistent quality checks regardless of response source
5. **Routing and Aggregation**: Prepare normalized data for insights synthesis
