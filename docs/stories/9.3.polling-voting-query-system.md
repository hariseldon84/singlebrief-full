## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story enables democratic organizational decision-making and integrates with:
- Decision Tracking and Outcome Management (Story 8.8) for decision implementation
- Team Intelligence Analytics (Story 8.5) for voting pattern analysis
- Cross-Team Intelligence (Story 8.6) for organization-wide decision coordination
- Anonymous Feedback System (Story 9.2) for sensitive decision topics

### Technical Dependencies
- Real-time voting infrastructure with live result aggregation
- Voting algorithm implementation for multiple democratic methods
- Security framework for voting integrity and fraud prevention
- Analytics engine for decision pattern analysis and outcome tracking

### Voting Method Implementations
The system supports multiple democratic decision-making approaches:
- **Simple Majority**: Traditional yes/no or single-choice voting with majority rule
- **Multiple Choice**: Selection from predefined options with plurality or majority requirements
- **Ranked Choice**: Preference ranking with instant runoff or Borda count tabulation
- **Approval Voting**: Multiple option approval with highest approval winner
- **Consensus Building**: Iterative voting with discussion and refinement cycles
- **Weighted Voting**: Role or expertise-based vote weighting for specialized decisions

### Consensus Measurement Framework
The system measures decision legitimacy through multiple metrics:
- **Participation Rate**: Percentage of eligible voters who participate (target: 80%+)
- **Consensus Strength**: Agreement level and margin of victory analysis
- **Dissent Management**: Minority opinion capture and consideration
- **Decision Confidence**: Statistical significance and certainty measurement
- **Implementation Buy-in**: Post-decision support and commitment assessment

### Vote Security and Integrity
Multiple security layers protect democratic processes:
- **Identity Verification**: Ensure eligible voters and prevent duplicate voting
- **Vote Secrecy**: Protect individual vote privacy while enabling verification
- **Fraud Prevention**: Detect and prevent voting manipulation or coercion
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging without compromising voter privacy
- **Result Verification**: Mathematical validation of vote counting and aggregation

### Decision Integration Workflow
Voting integrates with organizational decision-making:
1. **Decision Initiation**: Identify decision requiring team input
2. **Poll Configuration**: Set voting method, participants, and timeline
3. **Voting Period**: Collect votes with real-time participation monitoring
4. **Result Analysis**: Analyze outcomes and consensus measurement
5. **Decision Implementation**: Track execution and accountability assignment
6. **Outcome Review**: Evaluate decision effectiveness and process improvement

### Performance Requirements
- Vote processing time: <50ms for vote submission and validation
- Real-time updates: <500ms for live result updates and participation tracking
- Security validation: <200ms for fraud detection and vote integrity verification
- Decision analysis: <30s for comprehensive vote analysis and consensus measurement
