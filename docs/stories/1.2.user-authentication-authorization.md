## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Based on the available architecture documentation:

#### Authentication Technology Stack
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **Authentication Framework**: OAuth 2.0 + Role-based access control
- **Backend**: FastAPI with secure authentication middleware
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL for user data with proper encryption
- **Frontend**: Next.js with secure authentication state management

#### Privacy-by-Design Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/3-privacy-by-design-principles.md]
- **Scoped Access**: Every data access must be scoped, logged, and consented
- **User Control**: Team members control what's shared with leads vs. kept local
- **Transparency**: Enterprise Admin Portal required for compliance & policy
- **Data Rights**: Memory can be toggled off, reset, or exported

#### Integration Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/1-core-modules.md]
Authentication must integrate with:
- **Consent & Privacy Layer**: Controls data access per user/team/org + audit logs
- **Memory Engine**: User-specific memory storage with privacy controls
- **Integration Hub**: OAuth tokens for external service access
- **Dashboard & UI Layer**: Secure user interface access

#### Target User Requirements
[Source: docs/prd/4-target-users-personas.md]
- **Mid-to-senior managers** leading distributed teams
- **Founders & startup execs** managing multiple communication channels
- **Department heads** needing secure access to team intelligence
- **Product & Engineering leaders** requiring cross-system access

### Security Implementation Standards

#### JWT Token Security
- Use secure secret rotation and RS256 algorithm
- Implement short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) with refresh tokens
- Add token blacklisting for logout and security events
- Include user context (role, organization, permissions) in token claims

#### OAuth 2.0 Integration
- Use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for mobile and SPA security
- Implement proper state parameter validation
- Store OAuth tokens encrypted at rest
- Add scope validation and minimal permission requests

#### Password Security
- Enforce strong password policies (12+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- Use bcrypt with adaptive cost factor (minimum 12 rounds)
- Implement password history to prevent reuse
- Add breach detection using HaveIBeenPwned API

#### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest using AES-256
- Use TLS 1.3 for all data in transit
- Implement database-level encryption for PII
- Add audit logging for all authentication events

- **Integration Tests**: Full authentication workflows, role-based access
- **Security Tests**: Brute force protection, token security, session hijacking
- **Performance Tests**: Authentication under load, token validation speed
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user registration and login flows

#### Test Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 90% code coverage for authentication modules
- Security vulnerability testing with OWASP guidelines
