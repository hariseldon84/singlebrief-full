## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story enables proactive project management and integrates with:
- Advanced Analytics (Story 11.3) for strategic business intelligence correlation
- Memory-Driven Follow-ups (Story 11.5) for pattern-based project optimization
- Team Intelligence Analytics (Story 8.5) for comprehensive team performance insights
- Organizational Intelligence Platform for knowledge base and escalation systems

### Technical Dependencies
- Machine learning models for predictive project analytics and risk assessment
- Real-time analytics engine for project health monitoring and dashboard updates
- Integration framework for project management tools and timeline synchronization
- Advanced pattern recognition for project health assessment and risk prediction

### Project Health Assessment Framework
The system evaluates project health across multiple critical dimensions:
- **Schedule Performance**: On-time milestone completion and timeline adherence (25%)
- **Quality Metrics**: Deliverable quality, defect rates, and stakeholder satisfaction (20%)
- **Resource Health**: Team capacity, skill alignment, and resource optimization (20%)
- **Risk Indicators**: Identified risks, mitigation effectiveness, and emerging threats (15%)
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Communication quality, feedback responsiveness, and alignment (10%)
- **Financial Performance**: Budget adherence, cost efficiency, and ROI tracking (10%)

### Risk Detection Algorithm
The system identifies project risks using multiple data sources and patterns:
- **Historical Pattern Matching**: Comparison with similar past projects and outcome correlation (30%)
- **Real-time Indicator Analysis**: Current project metrics compared to healthy baselines (25%)
- **Team Sentiment Analysis**: Team communication patterns, satisfaction scores, and stress indicators (20%)
- **Resource Constraint Detection**: Capacity bottlenecks, skill gaps, and timeline pressure (15%)
- **External Factor Assessment**: Market changes, stakeholder shifts, and environmental impacts (10%)

### Predictive Analytics Models
The system forecasts project outcomes using advanced machine learning:
- **Timeline Prediction**: Delivery date forecasting with confidence intervals and scenario analysis
- **Success Probability**: Overall project success likelihood based on current trajectory
- **Quality Forecasting**: Expected deliverable quality and potential defect prediction
- **Resource Requirements**: Future resource needs and capacity planning optimization
- **Risk Materialization**: Probability of identified risks actually impacting the project

### Real-Time Dashboard Components
The project health dashboard provides comprehensive visibility:
- **Health Score Overview**: Single-metric project health with drill-down capabilities
- **Risk Heat Map**: Visual risk assessment with severity and probability indicators
- **Timeline Tracking**: Progress visualization with predictive completion estimates
- **Team Pulse**: Real-time team sentiment and engagement metrics
- **Action Items**: Prioritized recommendations for project improvement and risk mitigation

### Team Feedback Integration System
The system incorporates team input for comprehensive project assessment:
- **Continuous Pulse Surveys**: Regular team sentiment and confidence measurement
- **Feedback Correlation**: Relationship between team feedback and project outcomes
- **Communication Analysis**: Team communication patterns and collaboration effectiveness
- **Morale Impact Assessment**: Team satisfaction impact on project performance
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Stakeholder confidence and communication effectiveness measurement

### Project Management Tool Integration
The system seamlessly integrates with existing project management platforms:
- **Two-Way Synchronization**: Real-time data sync with project management tools
- **Unified Dashboard**: Consolidated view across multiple project management systems
- **Automated Updates**: Project status updates and milestone tracking synchronization
- **Alert Integration**: Risk alerts and recommendations pushed to existing workflow tools
- **Reporting Consistency**: Standardized reporting across different project management platforms

### Performance Requirements
- Health monitoring: Real-time project health assessment with <2 minute update frequency
- Risk detection: 85%+ accuracy in identifying potential project issues before escalation
