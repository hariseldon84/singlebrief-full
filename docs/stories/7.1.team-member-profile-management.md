## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **Backend**: FastAPI for team management APIs
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for team member profiles and relationships
- **Frontend**: Next.js for team management interface
- **Auth**: Role-based access control for team management permissions

### Collaborative Team Intelligence Requirements
[Source: docs/prd/epic-7-collaborative-team-intelligence.md]
The Team Member Profile Management System enables "user-defined team member management with roles, designations, and custom tags" and serves as the foundation for "intelligent query routing based on expertise"

### Integration Points
Must work with:
- User Authentication System for access controls
- Query Builder (Story 7.2) for team member selection
- Memory Engine for team member interaction history
- Email System (Story 7.3) for contact management
- Permission System (Story 7.6) for access controls

### Database Schema Requirements
- Team members table with profile data, roles, designations
- Tags table with flexible custom tag system
- Team relationships table for hierarchy mapping  
- Contact preferences table for communication settings
- Status tracking table for availability and workload

### Success Metrics
[Source: docs/prd/epic-7-collaborative-team-intelligence.md]
- Team member profile creation rate: 95%+ of users create team profiles
- Query routing accuracy: 90%+ correct team member targeting based on tags
- User satisfaction with team management interface: 85%+ positive feedback

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: Profile creation/editing tests, search and filtering accuracy, bulk import validation, hierarchy visualization, status management, contact preference handling
