## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story creates a critical organizational safety capability that integrates with:
- Query-Driven Business Metrics (Story 8.7) for organizational health insights
- Team Intelligence Analytics (Story 8.5) through anonymous behavioral patterns
- Cross-Team Intelligence (Story 8.6) for organization-wide feedback aggregation
- Daily Brief Generator (Epic 5) for anonymous insight reporting

### Technical Dependencies
- Advanced cryptographic infrastructure for anonymity guarantees
- Privacy-preserving analytics for aggregate insight generation without identity correlation
- Secure communication channels with complete audit trail separation
- Organizational health monitoring framework with anonymous metric generation

### Anonymity Architecture
The system implements multiple layers of anonymity protection:
- **Cryptographic Separation**: Zero-knowledge architecture with identity and content isolation
- **Session Anonymization**: Temporary anonymous sessions with no persistent identity linkage
- **Network Protection**: Anonymous routing through privacy-preserving communication channels
- **Data Isolation**: Complete separation of feedback content from user identification data
- **Aggregation Privacy**: K-anonymity and differential privacy for insight generation

### Sensitive Topic Categories
The system recognizes and handles various sensitive organizational topics:
- **Leadership Feedback**: Performance, decisions, and management effectiveness
- **Cultural Issues**: Discrimination, harassment, and inclusion concerns
- **Workplace Safety**: Physical, psychological, and emotional safety topics
- **Process Problems**: Inefficiencies, frustrations, and systemic issues
- **Personal Challenges**: Individual struggles affecting work performance
- **Strategic Concerns**: Direction, vision, and organizational strategy feedback

### Psychological Safety Framework
The system implements evidence-based psychological safety protocols:
- **Anonymity Guarantees**: Clear, legally-backed protection statements
- **Content Warnings**: Proactive identification of potentially triggering content
- **Safe Communication Guidelines**: Best practices for constructive anonymous feedback
- **Moderation Protocols**: Anonymous content review without identity exposure
- **Trust Building**: Transparency measures that build confidence in anonymity protection

### Organizational Health Metrics
Anonymous feedback generates actionable organizational insights:
- **Cultural Health**: Inclusion, belonging, and psychological safety indicators
- **Leadership Effectiveness**: Management quality and decision-making feedback
- **Process Satisfaction**: Workflow efficiency and system effectiveness
- **Communication Quality**: Organizational information flow and clarity
- **Innovation Climate**: Openness to ideas and creative problem-solving

### Performance Requirements
- Anonymity processing time: <100ms for anonymous session creation and feedback submission
- Analytics generation: Daily anonymous insight processing with <2 hour completion
- Identity protection: 100% identity separation with cryptographic verification
- Feedback aggregation: Real-time anonymous sentiment and trend analysis
