## Dev Notes

### Scalable Infrastructure Architecture
Enterprise-grade infrastructure with performance optimization:
- **Auto-Scaling**: Predictive scaling with 99.9% availability (30%)
- **Performance Optimization**: Sub-200ms response times under load (25%)
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-tier caching with global distribution (20%)
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas with query optimization (15%)
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking with predictive analytics (10%)

### Performance Requirements
- Response times: Sub-200ms for 95% of requests under maximum load
- Uptime: 99.9% availability with <5 minute recovery time
- Scaling: Auto-scaling handling 10x traffic spikes within 2 minutes
- Global performance: <300ms response times from any geographic location
