## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story provides the foundation for intelligent communication assistance and integrates with:
- Query Templates (Story 8.4) for proven pattern integration
- AI Conversation Memory (Story 8.1) for historical effectiveness analysis
- Smart Query Routing (Story 8.2) for response rate correlation
- Team Intelligence Analytics (Story 8.5) for communication pattern insights

### Technical Dependencies
- Advanced natural language processing for query analysis and improvement suggestions
- Machine learning pipeline for response rate prediction and effectiveness scoring
- Real-time suggestion engine for immediate feedback and optimization
- Integration framework for template system and historical data analysis

### Query Effectiveness Scoring Framework
The system evaluates queries across multiple dimensions:
- **Clarity Score**: Clear, unambiguous communication and question structure (25%)
- **Completeness Score**: Sufficient context and information for responders (20%)
- **Engagement Score**: Language that encourages participation and response (20%)
- **Specificity Score**: Precise questions that enable actionable responses (15%)
- **Urgency Appropriateness**: Proper urgency indication and timeline clarity (10%)
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Appropriate tone and cultural communication awareness (10%)

### Response Rate Prediction Algorithm
The system predicts response likelihood through multiple factors:
- **Historical Performance**: Similar query response rates and patterns (35%)
- **Query Quality Metrics**: Clarity, completeness, and engagement scores (30%)
- **Recipient Analysis**: Target audience availability and expertise alignment (20%)
- **Timing Factors**: Query timing and recipient schedule optimization (10%)
- **Context Factors**: Project status, team dynamics, and organizational priorities (5%)

### Real-Time Suggestion Categories
The assistant provides multiple types of real-time improvements:
- **Structural Improvements**: Question format, organization, and flow optimization
- **Clarity Enhancements**: Language simplification and ambiguity removal
- **Context Additions**: Background information and decision-making context
- **Engagement Optimization**: Language that encourages thoughtful responses
- **Specificity Improvements**: Precise questions that enable actionable feedback
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Tone and style appropriate for team communication norms

### Integration with Template System
The composer assistant leverages existing template knowledge:
- **Template Matching**: Automatic identification of applicable successful templates
- **Template Adaptation**: Customization of templates for specific contexts and users
- **Template Learning**: Incorporation of new successful patterns into template library
- **Template Effectiveness**: Correlation of template usage with improved response rates

### Performance Requirements
- Real-time analysis: <200ms for query analysis and suggestion generation
- Response prediction: 85%+ accuracy for response rate predictions
- Suggestion relevance: 90%+ user acceptance rate for improvement suggestions
- Template integration: <100ms for template matching and suggestion
