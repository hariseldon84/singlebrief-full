## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **Template Engine**: Jinja for dynamic content generation
- **PDF Generation**: PDFKit for document output
- **HTML Renderer**: For web-based brief display
- **Task Scheduling**: Celery for automated generation

### Daily Brief Generator Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/1-core-modules.md]
The Daily Brief Generator "Renders briefs (text, visual blocks, etc.) via templates" and must integrate with:
- Synthesizer Engine for content synthesis
- Memory Engine for personalization
- Trust Layer for confidence indicators
- Data Streams for source content

### Performance Requirements
[Source: docs/prd/6-success-metrics-kpis.md]
- Brief Accuracy Score target: 90% positive feedback
- Average Brief Response Time: <3 seconds
- Weekly Active Usage target: >50% of pilot orgs

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: Template rendering tests, content aggregation tests, scheduling tests, multi-format output tests, performance benchmarks
