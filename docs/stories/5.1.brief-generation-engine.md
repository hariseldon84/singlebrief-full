# Story 5.1: Brief Generation Engine

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system  
**I need** an automated brief generation engine  
**So that** personalized summaries can be created regularly for all users

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Template-based brief generation system
2. Content aggregation from all integrated data sources
3. Intelligent content prioritization and filtering
4. Brief scheduling and automation
5. Multi-format output generation (HTML, text, PDF)
6. Brief versioning and history tracking
7. Performance optimization for large-scale generation

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **Template Engine**: Jinja for dynamic content generation
- **PDF Generation**: PDFKit for document output
- **HTML Renderer**: For web-based brief display
- **Task Scheduling**: Celery for automated generation

### Daily Brief Generator Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/1-core-modules.md]
The Daily Brief Generator "Renders briefs (text, visual blocks, etc.) via templates" and must integrate with:
- Synthesizer Engine for content synthesis
- Memory Engine for personalization
- Trust Layer for confidence indicators
- Data Streams for source content

### Performance Requirements
[Source: docs/prd/6-success-metrics-kpis.md]
- Brief Accuracy Score target: 90% positive feedback
- Average Brief Response Time: <3 seconds
- Weekly Active Usage target: >50% of pilot orgs

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: Template rendering tests, content aggregation tests, scheduling tests, multi-format output tests, performance benchmarks
