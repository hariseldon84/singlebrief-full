# Story 7.8: Slack Response Collection and Integration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** team member using Slack with linked SingleBrief account  
**I want** to receive query notifications via 1:1 Slack bot direct messages and respond directly  
**So that** I can participate in team intelligence privately without leaving my primary communication tool

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Slack bot integration with workspace authentication for 1:1 direct messaging only
2. Query delivery via direct message to individual users (no channel/group messaging)
3. In-Slack response collection through direct message conversations and interactive forms
4. Real-time response status updates and confirmations within 1:1 bot conversation
5. Slack user ID mapping to SingleBrief team member profiles (from Story 7.1)
6. Response routing from Slack DMs back to Story 6.3 response orchestration system
7. User-controlled notification preferences for Slack delivery method
8. Slack account verification and linking validation during team member setup

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **Integration**: Slack API v2 with WebSocket Events API for real-time updates
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Slack SDK for bot management and message handling
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for Slack workspace and user mapping data
- **Queue System**: Celery for asynchronous Slack message processing

### Slack Integration Requirements
This implements platform-specific response collection that feeds into **Story 6.3 (Response Collection and Management)** as the central orchestration hub. Slack responses are normalized and routed to the main response processing pipeline.

### Integration Points
Must work with:
- **Story 6.3**: Response Collection and Management (primary routing destination)
- **Story 6.2**: Adaptive Communication and Tone Management (Slack-specific tone adaptation)
- **Story 7.1**: Team Member Profile Management (Slack user mapping)
- **Story 7.2**: Interactive Query Builder (Slack channel selection)
- **Story 4.2**: Slack Integration (existing Slack API infrastructure)

### Slack-Specific Features

**Query Delivery Options:**
- **Direct Messages**: Private queries to individual team members
- **Channel Messages**: Team-wide or group queries in specific channels
- **Thread Responses**: Organized conversation threading
- **Interactive Blocks**: Rich UI components for structured responses

**Response Collection Methods:**
- **Threaded Replies**: Natural conversation-style responses
- **Interactive Buttons**: Quick choice selection (Yes/No, A/B/C options)
- **Reaction Voting**: Simple emoji-based responses for quick feedback
- **Modal Forms**: Complex structured responses with multiple fields

### Slack Bot Capabilities
- **Workspace Installation**: OAuth flow with proper permissions
- **User Identity Mapping**: Link Slack users to SingleBrief team member profiles
- **Channel Management**: Configure which channels receive which types of queries
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live status updates and response acknowledgments
- **Slash Commands**: `/singlebrief` commands for power users

### Success Metrics
- Slack integration adoption: 80%+ teams with Slack workspaces enable integration
- In-Slack response rate: 75%+ response rate for Slack-delivered queries
- User satisfaction: 85%+ positive feedback on Slack experience
- Response time: 40% faster response times compared to email delivery

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: Slack API integration tests, bot authentication validation, message delivery accuracy, response collection and parsing, real-time update functionality, multi-workspace support
