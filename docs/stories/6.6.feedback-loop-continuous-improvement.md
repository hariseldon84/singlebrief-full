# Story 6.6: Feedback Loop and Continuous Improvement

## Status
Under QA

## Story
**As a** team member  
**I want** to provide feedback on AI interactions  
**So that** the questioning becomes more effective and less intrusive over time

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Interaction quality feedback collection
2. Response usefulness tracking for leaders
3. Communication preference learning
4. Question relevance and timing optimization
5. Trust and rapport building measurement
6. Intrusion and fatigue prevention
7. Continuous model improvement based on feedback
