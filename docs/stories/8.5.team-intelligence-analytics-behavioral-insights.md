## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story integrates multiple Epic 8 capabilities and connects with:
- AI Conversation Memory (Story 8.1) for historical behavior analysis
- Smart Query Routing (Story 8.2) for expertise and response pattern data
- Query Templates (Story 8.4) for communication effectiveness patterns
- Team Intelligence Platform (Epic 7) for team member profile integration

### Technical Dependencies
- Real-time analytics engine for behavioral pattern recognition
- Machine learning pipeline for predictive analytics and pattern correlation
- Data visualization framework for dashboard and reporting
- Privacy and security framework for compliant analytics

### Behavioral Analytics Framework
Key behavioral metrics tracked:
- **Communication Frequency**: Optimal interaction timing and frequency patterns
- **Response Patterns**: Speed, quality, and engagement level analysis
- **Collaboration Networks**: Team interaction mapping and influence analysis
- **Engagement Quality**: Depth of responses, follow-up engagement, outcome achievement
- **Performance Correlation**: Communication effectiveness impact on deliverables

### Insight Categories
The system provides insights across multiple dimensions:
- **Timing Optimization**: Best times for different types of communication
- **Communication Quality**: Patterns that lead to higher engagement and outcomes
- **Team Dynamics**: Collaboration patterns and relationship strength analysis
- **Performance Prediction**: Early indicators of team performance changes
- **Resource Optimization**: Communication ROI and efficiency improvements

### Privacy Design
All analytics follow privacy-by-design principles:
- **Aggregated Analytics**: Individual behavior aggregated to team-level insights
- **Opt-in Controls**: Team members control their data inclusion in analytics
- **Granular Permissions**: Leaders only see analytics they're authorized for
- **Anonymization**: Personal identifiers removed from behavioral pattern analysis

### Performance Requirements
- Real-time analytics processing: <200ms for dashboard updates
- Historical analysis: Process 90+ days of team interaction data
- Predictive accuracy: 80%+ accuracy for performance trend predictions
- Dashboard responsiveness: <500ms for interactive visualizations
