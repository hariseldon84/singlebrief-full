## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Next.js for interactive query builder interface
- **Backend**: FastAPI for query creation and team selection APIs
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI/Claude for query content analysis and suggestions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for query storage and team member data

### Query Builder Requirements
[Source: docs/prd/epic-7-collaborative-team-intelligence.md]
The Interactive Query Builder enables "user-initiated query routing to specific team members based on expertise" and "tag-based automatic team member suggestions based on query content"

### Integration Points
Must work with:
- Team Member Profile Management (Story 7.1) for team member data and tags
- Email Response Collection (Story 7.3) for query delivery
- Memory Engine for user preferences and query history
- Trust Layer for team member suggestion confidence
- Orchestrator Agent for AI-powered content analysis

### AI/ML Requirements
- NLP analysis of query content for expertise matching
- Team member recommendation engine based on tags and history
- Query complexity and effort estimation algorithms
- Delivery time optimization based on team member availability

### Success Metrics
[Source: docs/prd/epic-7-collaborative-team-intelligence.md]
- Query routing accuracy: 90%+ correct team member targeting based on tags
- User adoption: 85%+ users actively use query builder
- Team member suggestion accuracy: 80%+ user acceptance of AI suggestions

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: Query creation workflow tests, team member selection accuracy, AI suggestion validation, scheduling functionality, template system tests, attachment handling
