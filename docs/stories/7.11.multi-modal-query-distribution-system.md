# Story 7.11: Multi-Modal Query Distribution System

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** query creator  
**I want** to send a single query to multiple team members using different platforms for each person  
**So that** each team member receives the query on their preferred communication platform for maximum response rates

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Multi-platform query orchestration supporting mixed delivery methods in single query
2. Per-team-member platform selection with fallback options for delivery failure
3. Synchronized query delivery coordination across all platforms simultaneously
4. Unified query tracking and status management across multiple platforms
5. Cross-platform response correlation and duplicate detection
6. Platform-specific message customization while maintaining query consistency
7. Delivery confirmation and receipt tracking across all platforms
8. Failed delivery handling with automatic fallback to alternative platforms

  - [ ] Implement response correlation across platforms for same team member
  - [ ] Create duplicate response detection and merging logic
  - [ ] Build response priority handling when multiple platform responses exist
  - [ ] Add user notification for duplicate response scenarios
- [ ] Task 6: Platform-Specific Customization (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Create platform-appropriate message formatting and styling
  - [ ] Implement platform-specific interactive elements and features
  - [ ] Build consistent query content across different platform presentations
  - [ ] Add platform capability detection and feature adaptation
- [ ] Task 7: Delivery Failure and Fallback Management (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Implement automatic delivery failure detection
  - [ ] Create intelligent fallback platform selection and retry logic
  - [ ] Build delivery failure notification and reporting
  - [ ] Add manual delivery retry and platform switching capabilities

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **Backend**: FastAPI with complex orchestration logic for multi-platform coordination
- **Queue System**: Celery with Redis for synchronized delivery across platforms
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for delivery tracking and response correlation
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for live delivery status updates

### Multi-Modal Query Distribution Requirements
This serves as the central coordination system that orchestrates **Stories 7.3 (Email), 7.8 (Slack), 7.9 (Teams), and 7.10 (In-App)** to enable mixed-platform delivery in a single query operation.

### Integration Points
Must work with:
- **Story 7.1**: Team Member Profile Management (platform preference data)
- **Story 7.2**: Interactive Query Builder (platform selection interface)
- **Story 7.3**: Email Response Collection (email delivery coordination)
- **Story 7.8**: Slack Response Collection (Slack DM delivery coordination)
- **Story 7.9**: Teams Response Collection (Teams chat delivery coordination)
- **Story 7.10**: In-App Response Collection (in-app notification coordination)
- **Story 6.3**: Response Collection Management (unified response processing)

### Multi-Modal Distribution Examples

**Example Query Distribution:**
- **Team Member A** (preferred: Slack) → Receives via Slack DM + email backup
- **Team Member B** (preferred: Teams) → Receives via Teams chat + email backup  
- **Team Member C** (preferred: In-App) → Receives via in-app notification + email backup
- **Team Member D** (preferred: Email) → Receives via email only

**Delivery Coordination:**
1. **Query Creation**: User selects team members, system detects their platform preferences
2. **Platform Validation**: Check Slack/Teams account linking and availability
3. **Synchronized Dispatch**: Deliver to all platforms simultaneously
4. **Status Tracking**: Real-time delivery confirmation from each platform
5. **Response Correlation**: Link responses from different platforms to same query
6. **Fallback Handling**: Auto-retry via email if Slack/Teams delivery fails

### Platform Preference Hierarchy
1. **Primary Platform**: User's preferred platform (Slack, Teams, In-App)
2. **Fallback Platform**: Email (always available as backup)
3. **Emergency Platform**: In-app notification (for urgent queries)

### Success Metrics
- Multi-platform delivery success rate: 95%+ successful delivery across all selected platforms
- Response rate improvement: 25%+ higher response rates compared to single-platform delivery
- Platform preference accuracy: 90%+ correct platform selection based on user preferences
- Delivery synchronization: <30 seconds variance across all platforms for same query

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: Multi-platform delivery coordination tests, response correlation accuracy, delivery failure and fallback logic, platform preference detection, synchronized delivery timing, duplicate response handling
