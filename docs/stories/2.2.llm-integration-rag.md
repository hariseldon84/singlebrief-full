# Story 2.2: LLM Integration and RAG Pipeline

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system  
**I need** integrated LLM capabilities with retrieval-augmented generation  
**So that** queries can be answered using both AI knowledge and retrieved context

## Acceptance Criteria
1. OpenAI/Claude API integration with proper authentication
2. RAG pipeline for context retrieval and augmentation
3. Prompt engineering framework for different query types
4. Token management and cost optimization
5. Response streaming for real-time user feedback
6. Model switching capabilities for different use cases
7. Safety and content filtering mechanisms

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Based on the available architecture documentation:

#### LLM Technology Stack
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **LLM Providers**: OpenAI/Claude + RAG pipelines
- **Vector Database**: Weaviate or Pinecone for semantic search
- **Backend**: FastAPI for async LLM processing
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL for conversation logs, Redis for caching

#### Integration Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/1-core-modules.md]
The LLM integration must work with:
- Synthesizer Engine for content synthesis and deduplication
- Memory Engine for conversation context and personalization
- Trust Layer for confidence scoring of AI responses
- Data Streams Layer for retrieving relevant context

#### Privacy and Security
[Source: docs/architecture/3-privacy-by-design-principles.md]
- All LLM interactions must be logged and auditable
- User data sent to LLMs must be consented and scoped
- Content filtering must prevent sensitive data leakage
- Model responses must include proper attribution

#### Performance Requirements
[Source: docs/prd/6-success-metrics-kpis.md]
- Brief Response Time target: <3 seconds end-to-end
- Token optimization to control costs
- Streaming responses for better user experience
- High availability for LLM services

### Missing Architecture Documentation
No specific guidance found in architecture docs for:
- Specific prompt engineering patterns
- Vector database schema design
- Model selection criteria
- Cost optimization strategies

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: Based on foundation infrastructure setup:
- Unit tests for LLM client integrations
- Integration tests for RAG pipeline
- Performance tests for response time requirements
- Cost tests for token usage optimization
- Safety tests for content filtering
- Mock LLM responses for reliable testing
