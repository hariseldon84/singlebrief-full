# Story 2.2: LLM Integration and RAG Pipeline

## Status
Under QA

## Story
**As a** system

6. Model switching capabilities for different use cases
7. Safety and content filtering mechanisms

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Based on the available architecture documentation:

#### LLM Technology Stack
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **LLM Providers**: OpenAI/Claude + RAG pipelines
- **Vector Database**: Weaviate or Pinecone for semantic search
- **Backend**: FastAPI for async LLM processing
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL for conversation logs, Redis for caching

#### Integration Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/1-core-modules.md]
The LLM integration must work with:
- Synthesizer Engine for content synthesis and deduplication
- Memory Engine for conversation context and personalization
- Trust Layer for confidence scoring of AI responses
- Data Streams Layer for retrieving relevant context

#### Privacy and Security
[Source: docs/architecture/3-privacy-by-design-principles.md]
- All LLM interactions must be logged and auditable
- User data sent to LLMs must be consented and scoped
- Content filtering must prevent sensitive data leakage
- Model responses must include proper attribution

#### Performance Requirements
[Source: docs/prd/6-success-metrics-kpis.md]
- Brief Response Time target: <3 seconds end-to-end
- Token optimization to control costs
- Streaming responses for better user experience
- High availability for LLM services

### Missing Architecture Documentation
No specific guidance found in architecture docs for:
- Specific prompt engineering patterns
- Vector database schema design
- Model selection criteria
- Cost optimization strategies

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: Based on foundation infrastructure setup:
- Unit tests for LLM client integrations
- Integration tests for RAG pipeline
- Performance tests for response time requirements
- Cost tests for token usage optimization
- Safety tests for content filtering
- Mock LLM responses for reliable testing
