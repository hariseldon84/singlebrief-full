## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Based on the available architecture documentation:

#### Orchestrator Technology Stack
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI for high-performance async processing
- **AI Framework**: LangChain for LLM integration and agents
- **Task Queue**: Celery for background processing
- **Message Broker**: Redis for task queue and coordination

#### Core Orchestrator Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/1-core-modules.md]
The Orchestrator Agent serves as "Brain of the system that receives queries and decides what intel to gather from where" using "Python, LangChain, Celery (task queue)" and must coordinate with:
- **Team Comms Crawler**: For communication data
- **Memory Engine**: For persistent context and personalization
- **Synthesizer Engine**: For response generation and synthesis
- **Integration Hub**: For external data source coordination
- **Trust Layer**: For confidence scoring and validation

#### Data Flow Integration
[Source: docs/architecture/2-data-flow-diagram-simplified.md]
The orchestrator sits at the center of the data flow:
Team Lead Query → Orchestrator Agent → Multiple Data Sources → Synthesizer Engine → Trust Layer → Daily Brief Generator

#### Performance Requirements
[Source: docs/prd/6-success-metrics-kpis.md]
- **Average Brief Response Time**: <3 seconds
- **Team Response Compliance**: 85% response rate to agent prompts
- **Brief Accuracy Score**: 90% positive feedback on usefulness

### Orchestrator Design Patterns

#### Module Coordination Architecture
```python
class OrchestratorAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.modules = ModuleRegistry()
        self.query_parser = QueryParser()
        self.response_synthesizer = ResponseSynthesizer()
        self.task_queue = CeleryQueue()
        
    async def process_query(self, query: str, context: dict) -> Response:
        # Parse and classify query
        parsed_query = self.query_parser.parse(query)
        
        # Route to appropriate modules
        tasks = self.route_to_modules(parsed_query, context)
        
        # Execute tasks asynchronously
        results = await self.execute_tasks(tasks)
        
        # Synthesize response
        return self.response_synthesizer.synthesize(results)
```

#### Module Registry System
- **Dynamic Module Registration**: Modules self-register with capabilities
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks for all modules
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute load across module instances
- **Dependency Management**: Handle module dependencies and initialization order

#### Query Processing Pipeline
1. **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate user queries
2. **Intent Classification**: Determine query type and required modules
3. **Context Extraction**: Extract relevant context from query and user history
4. **Module Routing**: Route query components to appropriate modules
5. **Parallel Execution**: Execute module tasks concurrently
6. **Response Synthesis**: Combine and format responses
7. **Quality Validation**: Validate response quality and completeness

### Integration with Foundation Components

#### Authentication Integration (Story 1.2)
- Role-based query processing permissions
- User context injection for personalized responses
- Organization and team context for data access
- Audit logging for all query processing activities

#### Database Integration (Story 1.3)
- Query history storage and tracking
- User preference integration for response formatting
- Audit trail storage for transparency
- Performance metrics and analytics storage

#### Dashboard Integration (Story 1.4)
- Real-time query processing status updates
- WebSocket connections for live response streaming
- Error reporting and user feedback collection
- Integration status display and health monitoring

### Missing Architecture Documentation
No specific guidance found in architecture docs for:
- Detailed orchestrator design patterns
- Specific LangChain integration patterns
- Module communication protocols
- Query complexity assessment algorithms

### Testing Standards

#### Orchestrator Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Individual module coordination and query processing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end query processing workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Response time under various load conditions
- **Resilience Tests**: Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Concurrency Tests**: Parallel query processing and resource management
- **Security Tests**: Authentication and authorization enforcement

#### Test Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 90% code coverage for orchestrator core logic
- 100% coverage for error handling and recovery paths
- Performance benchmarks for <3 second response time requirement
- Load testing with concurrent users and complex queries
