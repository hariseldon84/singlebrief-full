# Story 12.2: Organizational Intelligence Graph Engine

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As an** organizational intelligence system  
**I want** to map people, knowledge, decisions, and sentiment into a real-time intelligence graph  
**So that** I can provide organizational neural network insights and pattern recognition

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Real-time organizational relationship mapping with graph database and permission-aware access
2. Permission-based access control for sensitive relationship data with granular privacy settings
3. Network analysis algorithms for influence and knowledge flow with 90%+ pattern accuracy
4. Dynamic organizational neural graph with temporal pattern recognition and evolution tracking
5. Team-topic affinity modeling with expertise strength scoring and recommendation engine
6. Cross-department synthesis with silo-breaking insights and collaboration recommendations
7. Connection intelligence scoring with success rate predictions for team formations

## Dev Notes

### Graph Intelligence Architecture
Organizational neural network with comprehensive relationship modeling:
- **People Networks**: Authority, influence, collaboration patterns, expertise distribution (35%)
- **Knowledge Networks**: Information flow, expertise connections, learning pathways (25%)
- **Decision Networks**: Decision makers, influencers, approval chains, outcome patterns (20%)
- **Sentiment Networks**: Emotional connections, cultural patterns, team dynamics (15%)
- **Project Networks**: Collaboration patterns, success factors, resource allocation (5%)

### Performance Requirements
- Graph updates: Real-time relationship mapping with <5 second propagation
- Network analysis: 90%+ accuracy in organizational pattern recognition
- Permission control: 100% data privacy with granular access management
- Prediction accuracy: 85%+ success rate for team formation and collaboration recommendations
