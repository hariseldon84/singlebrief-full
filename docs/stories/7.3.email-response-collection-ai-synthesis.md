## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **Email Service**: SMTP integration with delivery tracking
- **Backend**: FastAPI for response processing APIs
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI/Claude for response synthesis and analysis
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for response storage and tracking
- **Queue System**: Celery for asynchronous email processing

### Email Integration Requirements
[Source: docs/prd/epic-7-collaborative-team-intelligence.md]
The Email Response Collection System enables "email-based team collaboration with AI response synthesis" and "automated email delivery to selected team members with response aggregation"

### Integration Points
Must work with:
- Interactive Query Builder (Story 7.2) for query context and team member selection
- Team Member Profile Management (Story 7.1) for contact information and preferences
- Raw Team Response Viewer (Story 7.4) for response display
- Synthesizer Engine for AI-powered response analysis
- Memory Engine for team member interaction history

### Email Processing Pipeline
1. Query creation triggers personalized email generation
2. Email delivery with tracking and unique response identifiers
3. Inbound email parsing and content extraction
4. Response validation and quality assessment
5. AI synthesis and aggregation of all responses
6. Follow-up generation and reminder scheduling

### Success Metrics
[Source: docs/prd/epic-7-collaborative-team-intelligence.md]
- Email response rate: 80%+ team members respond to emailed queries
- Response quality score: 85%+ responses meet quality thresholds
- Synthesis accuracy: 90%+ user satisfaction with AI-generated summaries

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: Email delivery and parsing tests, response extraction accuracy, AI synthesis quality, threading and follow-up logic, attachment handling, reminder system functionality
