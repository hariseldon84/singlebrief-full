# Story 7.6: Real-Time Query Access and Permissions

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** query initiator  
**I want** to grant selective team members live access to query results and intelligence  
**So that** we can collaborate on insights and decision-making in real-time

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Granular permission system for query access control
2. Real-time query result sharing with selected team members
3. Live collaboration features (comments, reactions, annotations)
4. Query access invitation and approval workflow
5. Real-time notifications for query updates and new responses
6. Collaborative intelligence workspace with version control
7. Permission inheritance and role-based access controls
8. Audit trail for query access and collaboration activities

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Granular Permission System (AC: 1, 7)
  - [ ] Design permission matrix for query access levels
  - [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC) system

  - [ ] Add annotation and highlighting capabilities
  - [ ] Build collaborative editing for query refinement
- [ ] Task 4: Access Invitation and Approval (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create query access invitation workflow
  - [ ] Implement approval system for sensitive queries
  - [ ] Add access request and approval notifications
  - [ ] Build access revocation and expiration management
- [ ] Task 5: Collaborative Intelligence Workspace (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Create shared workspace interface for query collaboration
  - [ ] Implement version control for collaborative edits
  - [ ] Add workspace history and change tracking
  - [ ] Build collaborative decision-making tools and voting
- [ ] Task 6: Audit and Security (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Implement comprehensive audit trail for all access and actions
  - [ ] Create security monitoring for unauthorized access attempts
  - [ ] Add compliance reporting for data access and sharing
  - [ ] Build access analytics and usage patterns

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Next.js with WebSocket integration for real-time features
- **Backend**: FastAPI with WebSocket support for live collaboration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with permission schema and audit logging
- **Real-time**: Redis for WebSocket session management and pub/sub
- **Security**: Enhanced JWT with fine-grained permission tokens

### Real-Time Collaboration Requirements
[Source: docs/prd/epic-7-collaborative-team-intelligence.md]
The Real-Time Query Access system enables "real-time collaborative intelligence sharing with granular permissions" and "live collaboration features with permission management"

### Integration Points
Must work with:
- Team Member Profile Management (Story 7.1) for team hierarchy and roles
- Freemium Team Member Onboarding (Story 7.5) for account access levels
- Raw Team Response Viewer (Story 7.4) for collaborative viewing
- Email Response Collection (Story 7.3) for live response updates
- User Authentication System for permission validation
- Memory Engine for collaboration history and patterns

### Real-Time Architecture Requirements
- WebSocket connections for live updates and collaboration
- Pub/Sub system for scalable real-time messaging
- Session management for collaborative workspaces
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Real-time presence and activity indicators

### Permission Model Design
**Query Access Levels:**
- **View Only**: Can see query results and AI synthesis
- **Comment**: Can add comments and reactions
- **Collaborate**: Can annotate and suggest edits
- **Full Access**: Can modify query and manage permissions

**Role-Based Permissions:**
- **Team Member**: Basic viewing and commenting
- **Team Lead**: Full collaboration and permission management
- **Admin**: System-wide access and audit capabilities

### Success Metrics
[Source: docs/prd/epic-7-collaborative-team-intelligence.md]
- Collaboration engagement: 60%+ active use of live query sharing features
- Permission accuracy: 95%+ correct access control implementation
- Real-time performance: <100ms latency for live updates

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: Permission system validation, real-time synchronization tests, collaborative feature functionality, WebSocket connection stability, audit trail accuracy, security and access control tests
