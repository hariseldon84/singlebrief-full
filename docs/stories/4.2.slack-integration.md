## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **Integration Framework**: REST adapters for Slack API
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 integration
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL for message data, Redis for caching
- **Backend**: FastAPI for Slack webhook handling

### Integration Hub Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/1-core-modules.md]
Slack integration is part of the "Team Comms Crawler" that "Hooks into Slack, Teams, Emails to fetch context" using "Slack API, Gmail API, MS Graph"

### Data Flow Integration
[Source: docs/architecture/2-data-flow-diagram-simplified.md]
Slack data flows from Team Comms Crawler → Synthesizer Engine → Trust Layer → Daily Brief Generator

### Privacy and Permission Controls
[Source: docs/architecture/3-privacy-by-design-principles.md]
- Every data access must be scoped, logged, and consented
- Team members control what's shared with leads vs. kept local
- Must respect Slack workspace permissions and user privacy

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: Slack API integration tests, OAuth flow tests, real-time event processing tests, permission enforcement tests
