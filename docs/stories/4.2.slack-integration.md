# Story 4.2: Slack Integration and Team Communication Crawler

## Status
Under QA

## Story
**As a** manager  
**I want** SingleBrief to access relevant Slack conversations and updates  
**So that** I can get team insights without manually reading all channels

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Slack OAuth integration and workspace connection
2. Channel and DM message retrieval with filtering
3. Thread context and conversation tracking
4. Mention and keyword monitoring
5. Real-time message streaming via Slack Events API
6. User permission respecting (only accessible messages)
7. Message content indexing and search

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **Integration Framework**: REST adapters for Slack API
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 integration
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL for message data, Redis for caching
- **Backend**: FastAPI for Slack webhook handling

### Integration Hub Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/1-core-modules.md]
Slack integration is part of the "Team Comms Crawler" that "Hooks into Slack, Teams, Emails to fetch context" using "Slack API, Gmail API, MS Graph"

### Data Flow Integration
[Source: docs/architecture/2-data-flow-diagram-simplified.md]
Slack data flows from Team Comms Crawler → Synthesizer Engine → Trust Layer → Daily Brief Generator

### Privacy and Permission Controls
[Source: docs/architecture/3-privacy-by-design-principles.md]
- Every data access must be scoped, logged, and consented
- Team members control what's shared with leads vs. kept local
- Must respect Slack workspace permissions and user privacy

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: Slack API integration tests, OAuth flow tests, real-time event processing tests, permission enforcement tests

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Code (Sonnet 4) - Development Agent

### Implementation Status
Story 4.2 Slack Integration has been fully implemented with comprehensive service layer and API endpoints.

**✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION:**

**Core Service (`backend/app/integrations/slack_integration.py`):**
- Full OAuth 2.0 flow implementation with secure token storage
- Slack Web API integration with rate limiting and error handling
- Channel discovery and message retrieval with pagination
- Thread tracking and conversation context reconstruction
- Real-time event processing via Slack Events API
- Message search functionality across workspace
- Webhook signature verification and event routing
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**API Endpoints (`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/slack.py`):**
- `/slack/setup` - Configure Slack integration for organization
- `/slack/oauth/initiate` - Start OAuth flow with proper CSRF protection
- `/slack/oauth/complete` - Complete OAuth and store encrypted tokens
- `/slack/channels` - Retrieve accessible channels (public/private)
- `/slack/messages` - Fetch messages from specific channels with filtering
- `/slack/search` - Full-text search across workspace messages
- `/slack/webhooks/setup` - Configure real-time event subscriptions
- `/slack/webhooks/events` - Handle incoming webhook events from Slack
- `/slack/status` - Get integration status and health information

**Security Features:**
- OAuth 2.0 with secure token encryption (placeholder for production encryption)
- Webhook signature verification for event authenticity
- Permission-based access control respecting Slack workspace permissions
- CSRF protection with state parameters in OAuth flow
- Rate limiting integration with Integration Hub framework

**Real-time Capabilities:**
- Slack Events API integration for live message streaming
- Support for all major event types (messages, reactions, file sharing, etc.)
- Automatic data source initialization for discovered channels
- Event processing pipeline with error recovery

**Testing:**
- Comprehensive test suite covering service methods and API endpoints
- Mock-based testing for external API calls and database operations
- OAuth flow testing with simulated Slack responses
- Webhook event processing validation

### File List
**Created/Modified Files:**
- `backend/app/integrations/__init__.py` - Integration modules package
- `backend/app/integrations/slack_integration.py` - Core Slack integration service
- `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/slack.py` - Slack API endpoints
- `backend/app/api/v1/api.py` - Added Slack router to main API
- `backend/tests/test_slack_integration.py` - Comprehensive test suite

### Debug Log References
No debugging issues encountered. Implementation follows established patterns and integrates cleanly with Integration Hub framework.

### Completion Notes
- Full Slack workspace integration with OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Real-time message streaming via Events API with webhook handling
- Message retrieval, search, and thread context tracking
- Comprehensive error handling and rate limiting
- Security features including token encryption and webhook verification
- Ready for production deployment pending proper encryption key management
- Integrates seamlessly with Integration Hub framework from Story 4.1
