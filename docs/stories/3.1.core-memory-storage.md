## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **Primary Storage**: PostgreSQL for structured memory data
- **Vector Database**: Weaviate or Pinecone for semantic search
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed memories
- **Backend**: FastAPI for memory management APIs

### Memory Engine Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/1-core-modules.md]
The Memory Engine must provide "Long-term user-specific + team-level memory storage" and integrate with:
- Orchestrator Agent for query context
- Synthesizer Engine for personalized responses
- Team Interrogation AI for relationship context
- Trust Layer for memory confidence scoring

### Privacy Controls
[Source: docs/architecture/3-privacy-by-design-principles.md]
- Memory can be toggled off, reset, or exported
- Team members control what's shared vs. kept local
- All memory access must be logged and consented

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: PostgreSQL integration tests, vector search performance tests, memory lifecycle tests, privacy compliance tests
