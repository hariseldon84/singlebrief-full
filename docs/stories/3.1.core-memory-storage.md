# Story 3.1: Core Memory Storage System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system  
**I need** persistent storage for conversations and user interactions  
**So that** context can be maintained across sessions and time

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Conversation history storage with full context
2. Decision tracking and outcome recording
3. User interaction pattern storage
4. Vector embeddings for semantic search
5. Memory expiration and archival policies
6. Data compression for long-term storage
7. Cross-session context retrieval

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Memory Database Schema Design (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Design conversation storage schema
  - [ ] Create decision tracking data models
  - [ ] Implement user interaction pattern tables
  - [ ] Add proper indexing for performance
- [ ] Task 2: Vector Embedding Integration (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Set up vector database for semantic memory search
  - [ ] Implement embedding generation for conversations
  - [ ] Create semantic similarity search functionality
  - [ ] Add vector indexing and retrieval optimization
- [ ] Task 3: Memory Lifecycle Management (AC: 5, 6)
  - [ ] Implement memory expiration policies
  - [ ] Create data archival and compression systems
  - [ ] Add memory cleanup and optimization
  - [ ] Build memory size monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Task 4: Context Retrieval System (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Create cross-session context retrieval API
  - [ ] Implement relevance scoring for memories
  - [ ] Add context aggregation and summarization
  - [ ] Build memory search and filtering capabilities

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **Primary Storage**: PostgreSQL for structured memory data
- **Vector Database**: Weaviate or Pinecone for semantic search
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed memories
- **Backend**: FastAPI for memory management APIs

### Memory Engine Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/1-core-modules.md]
The Memory Engine must provide "Long-term user-specific + team-level memory storage" and integrate with:
- Orchestrator Agent for query context
- Synthesizer Engine for personalized responses
- Team Interrogation AI for relationship context
- Trust Layer for memory confidence scoring

### Privacy Controls
[Source: docs/architecture/3-privacy-by-design-principles.md]
- Memory can be toggled off, reset, or exported
- Team members control what's shared vs. kept local
- All memory access must be logged and consented

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: PostgreSQL integration tests, vector search performance tests, memory lifecycle tests, privacy compliance tests
