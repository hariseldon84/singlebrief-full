## Status
Planning

## Story
**As a** team member

5. Email threading maintains conversation context and history
6. Secure email validation to prevent spam and unauthorized responses
7. Seamless integration between email responses and in-app chat participants

## Technical Requirements

### Email Infrastructure
- **Email Service Provider**: Integration with SendGrid, AWS SES, or similar
- **Domain Configuration**: Custom domain for reply-to addresses
- **Email Parsing**: Robust email content extraction and cleaning
- **Security**: SPF, DKIM, DMARC configuration for email authenticity

### Chat Integration
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live email-to-chat updates
- **Message Threading**: Proper conversation threading and organization
- **Content Formatting**: Rich text support for email content display
- **Attachment Handling**: Support for email attachments in chat interface

### Security and Validation
- **Sender Verification**: Ensure email responses come from authorized team members
- **Content Filtering**: Spam detection and inappropriate content filtering
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent email spam and abuse
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for email responses and security events

## Email-to-Chat Technical Architecture

### Email Processing Pipeline
```yaml
email_processing:
  1_receive: Incoming email to unique reply-to address
  2_validate: Verify sender, check thread mapping, security validation
  3_parse: Extract content, remove signatures, handle formatting
  4_enrich: Add metadata, timestamp, sender information
  5_integrate: Insert into chat thread with proper threading
  6_notify: Update in-app users about new email response
  7_analyze: Track metrics and response quality
```

### Thread Mapping System
```yaml
thread_mapping:
  email_format: "chat-{query-id}-{member-id}@replies.singlebrief.com"
  database_mapping:
    - thread_id: Links to intelligence query
    - member_id: Links to specific team member
    - email_address: Generated unique address
    - created_at: Thread creation timestamp
    - expires_at: Email address expiration (e.g., 30 days)
```

### Security Framework
```yaml
email_security:
  sender_validation:
    - Verify sender email matches team member email
    - Check SPF/DKIM/DMARC authentication
    - Validate against organization member list
  content_filtering:
    - Spam detection and filtering
    - Malicious content and link scanning
    - Inappropriate content filtering
  rate_limiting:
    - Max 10 responses per thread per day
    - Max 3 responses per hour per member
    - Progressive throttling for suspicious activity
```

## User Experience Flow

### Email Response Workflow
1. **Receive Notification**: Team member gets email notification for intelligence query
2. **Email Content**: Personalized question with context and reply instructions
3. **Reply via Email**: Team member replies directly to notification email
4. **Automatic Processing**: System parses email and adds to chat thread
5. **In-App Integration**: Response appears in chat with email indicator
6. **Continuation**: Team member can continue conversation in-app or via email

### Chat Thread Experience
1. **Unified View**: All responses (in-app and email) shown in single thread
2. **Source Indicators**: Clear visual distinction between response types
3. **Rich Formatting**: Email content properly formatted for chat display
4. **Response Options**: Team members can switch between email and in-app responses
5. **Thread History**: Complete conversation history accessible to all participants

## Integration Points

### Intelligence System Integration
