## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Based on the available architecture documentation:

#### Database Technology Stack
[Source: docs/architecture/4-deployment-stack.md]
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data
- **Vector Database**: Weaviate or Pinecone for semantic search
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for session and frequently accessed data
- **Storage**: S3 for file and document storage

#### Core Module Data Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/1-core-modules.md]
The database must support all core modules:
- **Memory Engine**: "Long-term user-specific + team-level memory storage"
- **Consent & Privacy Layer**: "Controls data access per user/team/org + audit logs"
- **Integration Hub**: "Scalable plug-in system for tools" with credential management
- **Trust Layer**: "Custom scoring logic + source metadata"
- **Feedback Engine**: "Embedding store + metrics pipeline"

#### Privacy and Compliance Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/3-privacy-by-design-principles.md]
- **Audit Requirements**: Every data access must be scoped, logged, and consented
- **User Control**: Team members control what's shared vs. kept local
- **Data Rights**: Memory can be toggled off, reset, or exported
- **Enterprise Compliance**: Admin portal for compliance & policy management

#### Performance Requirements
[Source: docs/prd/6-success-metrics-kpis.md]
- **Response Time**: <3 seconds for brief generation
- **Memory Opt-in**: 60%+ users opting for persistent memory
- **Weekly Usage**: >50% of pilot organizations using consistently

### Database Schema Design

#### Core Entity Relationships
```sql
-- User Management Hierarchy
Users (1:N) Organizations (1:N) Teams (N:M) Users
Users (1:N) UserRoles (N:1) Roles
Organizations (1:N) OrganizationSettings

-- Memory System
Users (1:N) UserMemories (N:1) MemoryCategories
Teams (1:N) TeamMemories (N:1) MemoryCategories
Conversations (1:N) ConversationMessages
Decisions (N:1) Users, (N:1) Teams

-- Integration Framework
Organizations (1:N) Integrations (1:N) OAuthTokens
Users (1:N) IntegrationPermissions (N:1) Integrations
DataSources (N:1) Integrations

-- Audit and Compliance
Users (1:N) AuditLogs, ConsentRecords, DataAccessLogs
Organizations (1:N) ComplianceReports
```

#### Critical Indexes for Performance
- Users: email, organization_id, created_at
- UserMemories: user_id, created_at, category_id
- Conversations: user_id, team_id, created_at
- AuditLogs: user_id, action_type, created_at
- Integrations: organization_id, service_type, status
- OAuthTokens: integration_id, expires_at

#### Data Encryption Strategy
- **At Rest**: Encrypt PII fields (email, names, sensitive memories)
- **OAuth Tokens**: Full encryption with separate key management
- **Audit Logs**: Selective encryption for sensitive actions
- **Memory Content**: Encryption with user-controlled keys

### Integration with Future Modules

#### Vector Database Integration
- MemoryEmbeddings table will store vector representations
- Integration with Weaviate/Pinecone for semantic search
- Embedding versioning for model updates
- Cross-reference between relational and vector data

#### AI Model Integration
- ConversationContext for LLM interactions
- ModelResponses for tracking AI-generated content
- ConfidenceScores for trust layer implementation
- FeedbackData for continuous improvement

### Missing Architecture Documentation
No specific guidance found in architecture docs for:
- Detailed database schema specifications
- Specific encryption requirements
- Data retention policies
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

### Testing Standards

#### Database Testing Requirements
- **Schema Tests**: Validate all table creation and constraints
- **Migration Tests**: Test forward and backward migrations
- **Performance Tests**: Query performance under load
- **Data Integrity Tests**: Referential integrity and constraint validation
- **Security Tests**: Encryption and access control validation
- **Backup/Recovery Tests**: Data persistence and recovery procedures

#### Test Data Management
- Automated test data generation for all models
- Test database seeding with realistic data volumes
- Data anonymization for development environments
- Performance testing with production-scale data volumes
