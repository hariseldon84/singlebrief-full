# Story 8.4: Query Templates and Success Pattern Learning

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** query creator  
**I want** SingleBrief to suggest proven query templates based on successful patterns  
**So that** I can improve response rates and communication effectiveness

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Success pattern detection system that identifies high-performing query structures
2. Template generation engine that creates reusable query templates from successful patterns
3. Template usage suggestions with effectiveness metrics and success probability
4. Collaborative template improvement allowing team members to enhance shared templates
5. Context-aware template recommendations based on query intent and domain
6. Template performance tracking with response rate and quality metrics
7. Template library management with categorization and search functionality

- [ ] Task 2: Template Generation Engine (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Design automatic template extraction from successful patterns
  - [ ] Implement template generalization and parameterization
  - [ ] Create template quality scoring and validation
  - [ ] Build template versioning and evolution tracking
- [ ] Task 3: Smart Template Suggestions (AC: 3, 5)
  - [ ] Develop context-aware recommendation algorithms
  - [ ] Implement intent matching for template suggestions
  - [ ] Create effectiveness prediction for template usage
  - [ ] Build real-time suggestion system integration
- [ ] Task 4: Collaborative Template System (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Design collaborative template editing interface
  - [ ] Implement team-based template sharing and permissions
  - [ ] Create template contribution and improvement tracking
  - [ ] Build template approval and quality control workflows
- [ ] Task 5: Template Management and Analytics (AC: 6, 7)
  - [ ] Implement template performance monitoring
  - [ ] Create template library with search and categorization
  - [ ] Build usage analytics and effectiveness reporting
  - [ ] Add template optimization recommendations

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story builds on AI Conversation Memory (Story 8.1) and Smart Query Routing (Story 8.2):
- Uses conversation memory for pattern analysis and success tracking
- Leverages routing data to correlate templates with response quality
- Integrates with Team Interrogation AI (Epic 6) for template application

### Technical Dependencies
- Pattern recognition algorithms for success identification
- Natural language processing for template generalization
- Machine learning for recommendation and effectiveness prediction
- Collaborative editing system for template management

### Success Pattern Analysis
The system identifies successful patterns using multiple metrics:
- **Response Rate**: Percentage of team members who respond (40%)
- **Response Quality**: Average helpfulness and relevance scores (30%)
- **Response Speed**: Time to first and complete responses (15%)
- **Follow-up Engagement**: Continued conversation and clarification (10%)
- **Outcome Success**: Achievement of query objectives (5%)

### Template Categories
Templates are organized by:
- **Intent Type**: Information gathering, decision making, status updates, problem solving
- **Domain**: Technical, business, operational, strategic, creative
- **Urgency**: Immediate, routine, long-term planning
- **Scope**: Individual, team, department, organization
- **Complexity**: Simple, multi-part, complex coordination

### Template Structure
Each template includes:
- **Base Structure**: Core question framework with placeholders
- **Context Guidance**: When and how to use the template effectively
- **Customization Points**: Areas for specific context insertion
- **Success Metrics**: Historical performance data and expectations
- **Usage Tips**: Best practices for template application

### Performance Requirements
- Pattern detection: Process 1,000+ queries for pattern identification
- Template suggestion time: <100ms for real-time query assistance
- Template effectiveness: 90%+ success rate improvement over ad-hoc queries
- Collaborative editing: Support 50+ simultaneous template editors
