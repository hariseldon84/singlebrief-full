## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Code (Sonnet 4) - Development Agent

### Implementation Under QA
Story 5.2 Content Intelligence and Prioritization has been FULLY IMPLEMENTED with advanced AI-powered features:

**‚úÖ COMPLETED FEATURES:**
- **Multi-Factor Importance Scoring**: Advanced algorithms considering content type, keywords, author authority, audience size, content quality, recency, categories, and cross-references
- **Urgency Detection**: Pattern-based and deadline-based urgency detection with confidence scoring and escalation recognition
- **Trend Analysis**: Comprehensive trend detection including emerging, escalating, recurring, declining, and stable patterns with velocity calculations
- **Risk and Opportunity Detection**: Multi-category risk identification (technical, schedule, resource, quality, compliance) and opportunity detection (efficiency, growth, innovation, cost saving)
- **Action Item Extraction**: Pattern-based extraction of actionable items with smart filtering and deduplication
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Content sentiment scoring using positive/negative indicators
- **Content Consolidation**: Duplicate detection, clustering, and context-aware selection with relevance optimization

**üèóÔ∏è IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS:**
- **ContentIntelligenceService**: Comprehensive service with multi-dimensional analysis capabilities
- **ImportanceCategory & UrgencyLevel**: Structured classification systems for prioritization
- **TrendAnalysis**: Advanced trend detection with velocity, confidence, and time-span analysis
- **ContentIntelligence**: Complete intelligence model with reasoning and confidence scoring
- **API Integration**: Fully integrated with brief generation service and REST API endpoints

### File List
**Implementation Files:**
- `backend/app/services/content_intelligence.py` - Complete content intelligence service with all algorithms
- Integration with `backend/app/services/brief_generation.py` for content processing
