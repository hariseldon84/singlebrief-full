# Epic 1: Foundation Infrastructure üèóÔ∏è

## Epic Overview
Build the foundational infrastructure for SingleBrief including core authentication, basic dashboard, and the orchestrator agent framework that will coordinate all other modules.

## Epic Goals
- Establish secure user authentication and authorization system
- Create basic web dashboard for user interaction
- Implement core orchestrator agent framework
- Set up foundational data models and database schema
- Establish basic project structure and development environment

## Epic Success Criteria
- Users can sign up, log in, and access secured dashboard
- Basic orchestrator agent can receive and process simple queries
- Core database models are in place for users, organizations, and basic memory
- Development environment is fully configured with testing framework
- Basic CI/CD pipeline is operational

## Stories

### Story 1.1: Project Setup and Infrastructure Foundation
**As a** developer  
**I want** a properly configured development environment with all core dependencies  
**So that** I can begin building SingleBrief features efficiently

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Project structure follows the unified architecture guidelines
2. All core dependencies (FastAPI, Next.js, PostgreSQL, Redis) are configured
3. Docker development environment is set up
4. Basic CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions is configured
5. Testing framework is configured for both frontend and backend
6. Environment variables and configuration management is implemented
7. Basic logging and monitoring setup is in place

### Story 1.2: User Authentication and Authorization System
**As a** manager or team lead  
**I want** to securely sign up and log into SingleBrief  
**So that** I can access personalized intelligence features

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. User registration with email verification
2. Secure login with JWT token management
3. OAuth 2.0 integration for Google Workspace and Microsoft 365
4. Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Team Member)
5. Organization/team management functionality
6. Password reset and account recovery flows
7. Consent and privacy controls for data access

### Story 1.3: Core Database Models and Schema
**As a** system  
**I need** foundational data models and database schema  
**So that** all SingleBrief modules can store and retrieve data consistently

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. User and Organization models with proper relationships
2. Basic Memory Engine schema for storing conversations and decisions
3. Integration Hub schema for third-party service connections
4. Audit logging schema for privacy and compliance
5. Database migrations and version control
6. Proper indexing for performance
7. Data validation and constraints at database level

### Story 1.4: Basic Dashboard and UI Framework
**As a** user  
**I want** a clean, responsive dashboard interface  
**So that** I can access SingleBrief features intuitively

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Responsive dashboard layout using Next.js and Tailwind CSS
2. Navigation structure for core features
3. User profile and settings management UI
4. Integration status and health indicators
5. Basic query input interface
6. Mobile-responsive design
7. Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Story 1.5: Orchestrator Agent Framework
**As a** system  
**I need** a core orchestrator agent that can coordinate intelligence gathering  
**So that** user queries can be processed and routed to appropriate modules

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Basic orchestrator agent class using Python and LangChain
2. Query parsing and intent recognition
3. Module routing and coordination framework
4. Basic response synthesis and formatting
5. Error handling and fallback mechanisms
6. Task queue integration with Celery
7. API endpoints for receiving and processing queries

## Technical Dependencies
- Authentication system must integrate with Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 APIs
- Database schema must support future memory engine and integration requirements
- Orchestrator agent must be extensible for future AI modules
- All components must follow the privacy-by-design principles
- Infrastructure must support the <3 second response time requirement

## Epic Completion Criteria
All 5 stories are completed and the foundation infrastructure can:
- Authenticate users securely
- Display a basic functional dashboard
- Process simple queries through the orchestrator agent
- Store and retrieve data from the foundational database models
- Demonstrate end-to-end functionality from login to query processing
