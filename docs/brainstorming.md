## 🔍 Analogy Mapping

| Analogy | Insights for Features |
|--------|------------------------|
| Military Intelligence Analyst | Source reliability scores, situational briefs |
| Executive Assistant | Meeting prep, context recall, personalized memory |
| Gartner Desk | Structured synthesis with citations |
| Alexa/Siri (Supercharged) | Cross-platform contextual retrieval |
| CIA Handler | Individual team intel collectors, trust thresholds |
| JARVIS | Pre-emptive support, proactive nudges |

**💡 Feature Ideas Inspired:**
1. Field Agent Interrogation Trees
2. Source Confidence Scores
3. Memory Thread per Person
4. Briefing Room Dashboard
5. Meeting Pre-Read Generator
6. Reverse Briefing
7. Priority Signal Detector

### Explanations
##### Field Agent Style Interrogation Tree
        Each team member is treated like an intel source.
        I adapts tone and depth based on past reliability or domain knowledge.
#### Confidence Score Per Source
        Like a military analyst, each input gets a “credibility rating” — based on history, clarity, and even how often they contradict others.
##### Briefing Room UI
        A control panel showing live conversations the AI is having with team members — like a flight radar for ongoing synthesis.
##### Memory Thread per Person
        Like a human EA, it keeps a living memory of interactions with each team member.
        Automatically surfaces past context when interacting again.
##### Meeting Pre-Read Generator
        Like an EA or JARVIS — generates briefing notes before meetings based on recent chats, calendar, doc changes, and decision logs.
##### Priority Signal Detector
        Like a CIA handler spotting urgent threats — this AI auto-flags unusual patterns in chat, deadlines, or files.
##### Nudge System
        AI can nudge team members who haven’t responded, or prompt them for more clarity — like an efficient coordinator.
##### Chain of Reasoning Reconstruction
        From a Gartner-style process: show user how this answer was formed — with linked reasoning across people & docs.
##### Reverse Briefing
        AI sends a quick summary to each team member after a decision — “This is what your input contributed to and what’s next.”

##### Obsolescence Warning Engine
        Based on the “what would replace you?” mindset — AI suggests what it doesn’t know yet and what should be added to improve.

## 👥 Persona-Powered Scenarios

1. **Maya (Marketing Manager)** — Cross-department campaign syncs  
2. **Ravi (Remote Tech Lead)** — Async daily briefs & blockers  
3. **Neha (Founder)** — Strategy brief, promise tracking  
4. **Sahil (Sales Ops)** — Briefbot for reps, evolving sales assets  
5. **Asha (HR BP)** — Sentiment briefs, recognition nudges

**Emerging Themes:**  
- Proactive > reactive AI  
- Personalization + memory  
- Actionable summaries

## 🌐 Data Streams Explosion

### Layer 1: Team Intelligence
- Slack, Docs, Project Mgmt, GitHub, Meetings, Feedback tools

### Layer 2: Personal Intelligence
- Email, Calendar, Notes, Files, CRM, YouTube, LinkedIn

### Layer 3: Learned Memory
- Decision logs
- Source trust index
- Strategy maps
- Cross-time context memory

**Agent Behaviors:**
- Clarification questions
- Follow-ups/nudges
- Highlighting gaps
- “Show reasoning” buttons

**Bonus Stream: Agent Actions / Behaviors**
The agent doesn’t just observe — it acts. So these data streams are interactive.
- ✅ Ask Clarification Questions from team members autonomously
- ✅ Send gentle nudges / reminders based on task urgency
- ✅ Highlight missing perspectives (e.g., “No input from Finance on this yet”)
- ✅ Suggest file/email/meeting link in response to a leader’s question

- Private data boundaries
- Shadow IT

### UX & Performance
- Too much info at once
- Latency from APIs
- Cognitive overload

**Mitigation Strategy**
- Source transparency
- Memory toggle
- Staged rollout: team → personal → infra
- Admin controls & audit logs
