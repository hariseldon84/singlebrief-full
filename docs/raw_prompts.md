### Prompt : Initiating Brainstorming

I want to build a product known as SingleBrief. This is built as an Intelligence Operative for managers and leaders for team-intelligence, database-intelligence and document-intelligence all in one.  It is like an ultimate AI based productivity module that helps team leaders / coordinators to synch all the communication from all sourced including individual team members via an actively interacting AI agent. Just as a case for team intelligene -: Imagine there is a team lead M who has team members A, B, C, D & E. There is a specific query / question that M has that can be answered by all of them. However it is tedious to collect all the information one by one from each of the team member and then crystallize and analyze the final info. Can we build an AI agent that answers the big question posted by lead M by individually interacting with A, B, C , D & E and then collectively replies to M with one final response that is analyzed. Similarly can we think about other intelligence beyond team for an individual user as well? (e.g. email, calendar, google drive , youtube or any other personalized source). No constraint. We want to build a full product and not an MVP here. Also we would want that there is a memory of this product built as we interact more with it and it asks more questions with each team members. So it gets trained more and more we use the same. 

#### Result for Brainstorming 
Reecommended Brainstorming Techniques
Analogy Mapping – Compare SingleBrief with well-known systems (e.g., executive assistants, military intel ops, GPT-based retrieval systems) to spark feature innovation.
Persona-Powered Scenarios – We’ll generate distinct user personas (Team Lead, HR, Sales Manager, Ops Head) and imagine how each would use SingleBrief.
“If I had a magic AI agent...” – A wish-based ideation game: what users would want if there were no tech limits.
Data Streams Explosion – A structured ideation round identifying all possible internal and external data sources SingleBrief could mine.
What Would Replace You? – Flip the script. Imagine someone wants to beat SingleBrief — what would they build to make it obsolete?
Red Flag Radar – Explore potential blockers, deal-breakers, and trust/fatigue risks early (because this kind of product deals with lots of data and user behavior).
