# SingleBrief

> **"Answers from everyone. Delivered by one."**

An AI-powered intelligence operative designed for managers and team leads that consolidates team intelligence, document data, and personal sources into one unified AI interface.

## 🎯 What is SingleBrief?

SingleBrief transforms how managers get updates by **proactively collecting, synthesizing, and delivering intelligence** rather than requiring users to chase updates across multiple sources. It includes persistent memory that learns over time and adapts to user/team behavior patterns.

Instead of spending hours gathering status updates from team members, documents, and tools, SingleBrief delivers synthesized, high-trust answers from fragmented information streams.
